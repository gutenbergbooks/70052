<h2 class="nobreak preface">PREFACE</h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>The Papers here collected and reprinted, with
some alterations, were not originally written as a
series; but they do, in fact, form one, inasmuch
as the opinions put forward in each Paper were
arrived at, one after the other, simply by following
one leading clue.</p>

<p>This clue was furnished by a consideration of
statements made by Professor Sayce in an article
contributed by him in 1874 to the <i>Transactions
of the Society of Biblical Archæology</i>.</p>

<p>At page 150 he thus wrote:—</p>

<div class="quote">

<p>“The standard astrological work of the
Babylonians and Assyrians was one consisting of
seventy tablets, drawn up for the Library of Sargon,
king of Agane, in the 16th century <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>”</p>

</div><!--quote-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Pageviii">[viii]</span></p>

<p>And again at page 237:—</p>

<div class="quote">

<p>“The Accadian Calendar was arranged so as
to suit the order of the Zodiacal signs; and Nisan,
the first month, answered to the first Zodiacal
sign. Now the sun still entered the first point of
Aries at the vernal equinox in the time of Hipparkhus,
and it would have done so since 2540
<span class="smcapall">B.C.</span> From that epoch backwards to 4698 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>
Taurus, the second sign of the Accadian Zodiac,
and the second month of the Accadian year,
would have introduced the spring. The precession
of the equinoxes thus enables us to fix the extreme
limit of the antiquity of the ancient Babylonian
Calendar, and of the origin of the Zodiacal signs
in that country.”</p>

</div><!--quote-->

<p>Not many years after this sentence had been
penned, archæologists, as the result of much
evidence, came to the firm conviction that the
date of Sargon of Agane was far earlier than
had been at first supposed; and it was placed by
them, not “in the 16th century <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>,” but at the
high date of 3800 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span></p>

<p>It was in endeavouring to account for the choice<span class="pagenum" id="Pageix">[ix]</span>
by Accadian astronomers of Nisan as first month
of the year, and of Aries as first constellation of
the Zodiac, at a date when that month and constellation
could not have “introduced the spring,”
that a possible solution of the difficulty presented
itself to my mind—namely, the supposition that
the Accadian calendar had been originated when
the <i>winter solstice</i>, not the <i>spring equinox</i>,
coincided with the sun’s entry into the constellation
Aries. This coincidence took place, as
astronomy teaches us, at the date, in round numbers,
of 6000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span></p>

<p>In the first Paper here reprinted this supposition
was put forward; and in the course of following, as
above stated, the clue afforded by it, the various
subjects discussed in successive Papers claimed
always more insistently my attention, as by degrees
detached pieces of information concerning the
calendars of ancient nations came to hand, and
fitted themselves, like the pieces of a dissected
map, into one simple chronological scheme.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Pagex">[x]</span></p>

<p>The study of calendars marked by Zodiacal
constellations necessitates an acquaintance with
the position of those constellations as they were
to be observed through the many ages during
which they held the important office of presiding
over the year and its changing seasons. Such
acquaintanceship would have involved very careful
and accurate calculations were it not that, by the
help of a precessional globe, it was possible by easy
mechanical adjustment to <i>see</i>, without the trouble
of thinking them out, what were the changes produced
in the scenery of nightly skies, millennium
after millennium, by the slow apparent revolution
of the “Poles of heaven” through the constellations—a
revolution referred to by English
astronomers as “the precession of the equinoxes,”
and more graphically and epigrammatically by
French astronomers as “le mouvement des
fixes.”</p>

<p>In the second part of this book diagrams have
been given, made from a precessional globe, and<span class="pagenum" id="Pagexi">[xi]</span>
in the explanatory notes which accompany the
Plates attention has been directed, not only to the
chronological problems which may be discussed
with great advantage, as I believe, by the help
of such a globe, but also to various astronomical
explanations of ancient myths which occurred to
me in the course of studying the position of
Zodiacal and extra-Zodiacal constellations at
different ages of the world’s history.</p>

<p>I can only read Classic and Oriental myths
in translations, and I feel very sure that if any
of the astronomic explanations here suggested for
ancient legends should prove to be the right
ones, scholars versed in the original languages
in which these legends were written, if they supplement
their linguistic knowledge by astronomic
considerations, will be able quickly and with ease
to develop the suggested explanations much further
than it has been possible for me to do; and explanations
of other astronomic myths—astronomic,
that is, and not merely solar myths—will doubtless<span class="pagenum" id="Pagexii">[xii]</span>
come to their minds as they follow similar lines
of enquiry.</p>

<p>The steps by which travellers arrive at a far-reaching
view are often very steep and arduous.
I fear that many readers of this book will find the
separate Papers in it dull and technical in themselves;
but if they be considered only as steep
and roughly-cut steps leading up to vantage points
of chronological and historical observation, I
believe that the ruggedness of the path will soon
be forgotten in the absorbing interest of the results
to be obtained by following it.</p>

THE ACCADIAN CALENDAR</h3>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p class="reprint">[Reprinted from the <i>Proceedings of the Society of Biblical
Archæology, January 1892</i>]</p>

<p>Epping and Strassmaier, in their book <i>Astronomisches
aus Babylon</i>, have lately translated three
small documents, originally inscribed on clay tablets
in the second century <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span> From these tablets, we
learn that the Babylonians of the above date possessed
a very advanced knowledge of the science
of astronomy. Into the question of the extent of
that knowledge we need not here enter further<span class="pagenum" id="Page2">[2]</span>
than to say that it enabled the Babylonian astronomers
to draw up almanacs for the ensuing
year; almanacs in which the eclipses of the sun
and moon, and the times of the new and full moon,
were accurately noted, as also the positions of the
planets throughout the year. These positions
were indicated by the nearness of the planet in
question to some star in the vicinity of the ecliptic,
and the ecliptic was portioned off into twelve
groups, coinciding very closely in position and
extent with the twelve divisions of the Zodiac
as we now know them.</p>

<p>As to the calendar or mode of reckoning
the year, we find that the order and names of
the twelve months were as follows: Nisannu (or
Nisan), Airu, Simannu, Dûzu, Abu, Ulûlu, Tischritu,
Arah-samna, Kislimu, Tebitu, Šabâtu, Adaru.</p>

<p>Of these months Ulûlu and Adaru could be
doubled as Ulûlu Sami (the second Elul), and
Adaru Arki (the last Adar). The Babylonian
years were soli-lunar: that is to say, the year
of twelve lunar months, containing three hundred
and fifty-four days, was bound to the solar
year of three hundred and sixty-five days by<span class="pagenum" id="Page3">[3]</span>
intercalating, as occasion required, a thirteenth
month.</p>

<p>Out of every eleven years there were seven
with twelve months, and four with thirteen months.
The first day of the year being, like some of our
church festivals, dependent on the time of the
new moon, was “moveable” (<i>schwankende</i>). The
year, according to the tablets before Epping and
Strassmaier, “<i>began with Nisan, hence in the
spring</i>.”<a id="FNanchor1" href="#Footnote1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote1" href="#FNanchor1" class="label">[1]</a> “Was den Anfang des Jahres betrifft, so haben wir schon
gezeigt, das die seleucidische Aera, wie sie in unseren drei Tafeln
vorliegt, ihre Jahre mit dem Nisan, also im Frühjahr begann.”
(Epping and Strassmaier, <i>Astronomisches aus Babylon</i>, p. 181).</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>This is a sketch of the Babylonian calendar
in the second century <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>, as drawn from the
work of the two learned Germans above-named.</p>

<p>Now we find in the British Museum a great
number of trade documents which, according to
the Catalogue, “cover a period of over two
thousand years.” There are “tablets of the
time of Rim-sin, Ḫammurabi, and Samsu-iluna;
tablets of the time of the Assyrian supremacy,
of the time of the native kings, and of the time<span class="pagenum" id="Page4">[4]</span>
of the Persian supremacy; tablets of the times of
the Seleucidæ, and the Arsacidæ.”<a id="FNanchor2" href="#Footnote2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote2" href="#FNanchor2" class="label">[2]</a> See
<i>Guide to the Nimroud Central Saloon</i>, B.M., 1886. The
dates of the rulers mentioned are as follows:—</p>

<p>Rim-sin, about 2,300 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span></p>

<p>Ḫammurabi, about 2,200 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span></p>

<p>Samsu-iluna, about 2,100 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span></p>

<p>Assyrian supremacy from about 1275 to 609 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span></p>

<p>The latest tablet in the collection is dated, according to the
Catalogue, 93 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span></p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>These documents are all dated in such and
such a month of such and such a year of some
king’s reign; the months are the same (at first
under their earlier Accadian names<a id="FNanchor3" href="#Footnote3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>)
as those we<span class="pagenum" id="Page5">[5]</span>
find in the almanacs translated by Epping and
Strassmaier, and we meet in them, and in other
historical inscriptions, with the intercalary months,
the second Elul, and the second Adar. It would
seem, then, that it was the same calendar, worked
in the same way, that held its place through these
two thousand years.<a id="FNanchor4" href="#Footnote4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p><a id="Footnote4" href="#FNanchor4" class="label">[4]</a> As evidence of the antiquity of a fixed calendrical method
of counting the year, and of a method closely resembling, if not
identical with, that used in the latest periods of Babylonian
history, the importance and trustworthiness of these documents
can scarcely be over-rated. They were inscribed on soft clay
(which was afterwards baked either by sun or fire), many of them
four thousand years ago. No correction or erasure can have
been made in them since that date. A translation of one of
these tablets as given at p. 75 in the <i>Guide to the Nimroud
Central Saloon</i>, is here given as an example of the style of many
others.</p>

<div class="quote">

<p>“No. 3. Tablet and outer case inscribed with a deed of
partnership or brotherhood between Sini-Innanna and Iriba<sup>m</sup>-Sin.</p>

<p>“Tablet. Ṣini-Innanna and Iriba<sup>m</sup>-Sin made brotherhood;
they took a judge for the ratification, and went down to the
temple of the sun-god, and he answered the people thus in the
temple of the sun-god: ‘They must give Arda-luštâmar-Šamaš
and Antu-lišlimam, the property of Iraba<sup>m</sup>-šin, and Ârdu-ibšînan
and Antu-am-anna-lamazi, the property of Ṣini-Innanna.’ He
proclaimed [also] in the temple of the sun-god and the moon-god:
‘Brother shall be kind to brother; brother shall not be evil
towards, shall not injure, brother; and brother shall not harbour
any angry thought as to anything about which a brother has
disputed.’</p>

<p>“They have invoked the name of Innannaki, Utu, Marduk,
Lugal-ki-ušuna, and the name of Ḫammurabi [Kîmta-rapaštu] the
king.”</p>

</div><!--quote-->

<p>Here follow the names of eight witnesses. The translation of the
inscription on the outer case is much to the same purpose, and need
not here be quoted; the names of nine witnesses are appended to
it. The <i>Guide</i> continues, after some other explanations, as follows:</p>

<div class="quote">

<p>“The whole of the first paragraph (except a few ideographs) is in
Semitic Babylonian. The invocation is in Akkadian. The list
of ‘witnesses,’ again, is in Semitic Babylonian, <i>and the date in
Akkadian</i>.... The tablet is dated in the same way as the other
documents of this class: ‘Month Adar of the year when Ḫammurabi
the king made (images of) Innanna and Nanâ.’”</p>

</div><!--quote-->

</div><!--footnote-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page6">[6]</span></p>

<p>But, further, there are astrological works copied
for the library of Assurbanipal from ancient Babylonian
originals. The compilation of many of these
originals is placed by scholars in the reign of Sargon
of Accad,<a id="FNanchor5" href="#Footnote5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
at the remote date of 3,800 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote5" href="#FNanchor5" class="label">[5]</a> Sargon I. of Accad was of Semitic race. He was established
as ruler in the city of Accad, and there reigned over a great
non-Semitic race, in ancient cuneiform inscriptions styled the
<i>Accadai</i> (Accadians). This word, as scholars tell us, carried the
meaning of “highlanders,” or “mountaineers.” From this fact it
is inferred they were not indigenous to the low plain surrounding
the city of Accad, to which they gave their name. Their language
contains few words for the productions of the almost
tropical climate of Babylonia, but it shows familiarity with those
of higher latitudes. At the time when Sargon, either by peaceful
or warlike arts, was established as ruler over the Accadians,
they were already a very highly civilized people. They possessed
a literature of their own, which embraced a wide variety of
subjects. The learning of the Accadians was highly esteemed,
and translations into the Semitic language were made of important
religious and scientific Accadian works. These works, down to
the latest days of Babylonian power, were preserved and venerated,
and many copies of them were made and preserved in public
libraries in Babylonia and Assyria.</p>

<p>The Accadian after Sargon’s date gradually dropped out
of general use, and became a “learned” language, holding
amongst Babylonians and Assyrians much the same position as
Latin and Greek amongst Europeans.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page7">[7]</span></p>

<p>In these ancient astrological works, the same
calendar referred to in the trade documents, and
in the late Babylonian almanacs, appears to obtain.
We find in them the same year of twelve lunar
months, reinforced at intervals by a thirteenth intercalated
month, and, which is very important, the
order of the months is always the same. Nisan
(Accadian Barzig-gar), everywhere appears as
“the first month,” and is distinctly stated to be
“the beginning of the year.”<a id="FNanchor6" href="#Footnote6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote6" href="#FNanchor6" class="label">[6]</a> See
<i>Transactions of the Society of Biblical Archæology</i>, 1874.
Paper entitled, <i>The Astronomy and Astrology of the Babylonians</i>,
Prof. Sayce, p. 258, W.A.I. iii. 60.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>As early as the year 1874, Professor Sayce
pointed out that there was good reason for supposing
that the twelve Babylonian months corresponded
to the twelve divisions of the Zodiac. At
page 161 of his Paper, <i>The Astronomy and<span class="pagenum" id="Page8">[8]</span>
Astrology of the Babylonians</i>, we read: “Now
a slight inspection of the calendar will show that
the Accadian months derived their names from the
signs of the Zodiac.”</p>

<p>He then proceeds to discuss and compare the
meanings of the Accadian and Semitic month
names, and to point out those in which a reference
to the Zodiac might most clearly be traced.</p>

<p>That the constellations of the Zodiac were from
a remote age recognized by the dwellers in Mesopotamia
is scarcely to be doubted. We find on the
boundary stones in the British Museum <i>representations</i>
of several of their figures. The Bull, the
Tortoise (in lieu of the Crab), a female figure with
wings, the Scorpion, the Archer, and the Goat-fish,
are all portrayed, not only on boundary stones, but
also on cylinder seals and gems.</p>

<p>Again, in the old astrological works, we find
<i>mention</i> of the Scorpion “Gir-tab,” and of the
Goat-fish “Muna-xa,” and as planets are said to
“approach to,” and “linger in,” the stars of Gir-tab
and of Muna-xa, it may well be supposed that
they were the Zodiacal constellations still represented
under the forms of Scorpion and Goat-fish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page9">[9]</span></p>

<p>Out of the many star-groups mentioned in the
old tablets, only a few have as yet been certainly
identified with their modern equivalents. As to
the identity of others, we may guess. For instance,
when it is said “Mercury<a id="FNanchor7" href="#Footnote7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> lingered in the constellation
Gula,” we may guess that Gula represents
Aquarius, which sign in the Epping and Strassmaier
tablets figures as “Gu.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote7" href="#FNanchor7" class="label">[7]</a> <i>Infra</i>, <a href="#Page47">p. 47</a>,
<a href="#Footnote26">note</a>.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>From all these sources of information, we gather
that the twelve divisions of the ecliptic had been
mapped out at the time the astrological works were
drawn up, and that some (at least) of these divisions
corresponded exactly to those now represented
on celestial globes.</p>

<p>The suggestion, therefore, put forward by Professor
Sayce and other scholars, that the twelve
Accadian months corresponded to the twelve
constellations of the Zodiac, and that we may
trace a resemblance in some instances between
the name of the month in the old Accadian language
and the constellation into which the sun
at that time of the year entered, is not in itself
improbable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page10">[10]</span></p>

<p>The following months are those in which this
resemblance is very striking:</p>

<p>1st month, Bar zig-gar (“the sacrifice of righteousness”),
Aries.</p>

<p>2nd month, Khar-sidi (“the propitious bull”),
Taurus.</p>

<p>3rd month (sometimes called) Kas (“the
Twins”), Gemini.</p>

<p>6th month, Ki Gingir-na (“the errand of
Istar”), Virgo.</p>

<p>We know from the Epping and Strassmaier
tablets as a matter of fact, that the months and
the constellations of the Zodiac <i>did</i> in the second
century, <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>, correspond with each other in order
and sequence as above suggested, and if further
research should establish the fact that they so
corresponded in Sargon’s time, then as we find
Nisan (Bar zig-gar) throughout all these ages
holding the place of “first month,” and marking
“the beginning of the year,” it will necessarily
follow that the Accadian, Babylonian, and Assyrian
calendars dealt with a <i>sidereal</i> and not a <i>tropical</i>
year.</p>

<p>Ours is a <i>tropical</i> year, that is to say, according<span class="pagenum" id="Page11">[11]</span>
to the Julian calendar (afterwards amended by Pope
Gregory) it is bound to the <i>seasons</i>, and its months
maintain a constant relation to the four great divisions
of the ecliptic, <i>i.e.</i> the solstices and the
equinoxes. The winter solstice always falls about
the 22nd of December, the spring equinox about
the 21st of March, the summer solstice about the
21st of June, and the autumnal equinox about the
23rd of September.</p>

<p>But (as has been suggested) the Accadian year
was a <i>sidereal</i> year, and its months maintained a
constant relation to the twelve <i>star-marked</i> divisions
of the ecliptic, or, as they are called, the
constellations of the Zodiac. Nisan always corresponded
(as closely as a lunar month might)
to the time during which the sun traversed the
constellation Aries; Airu to the time during which
it traversed the constellation Taurus; and so on
through the twelve months of the year.</p>

<p>The equinoctial points are, however, always,
though slowly, changing their position amongst the
twelve constellations of the ecliptic. The months,
therefore, which in 3,800 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>, and still in the second
century <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>, corresponded to the same star-groups,<span class="pagenum" id="Page12">[12]</span>
as above noted, must have held in different ages
very different positions in regard to the four great
divisions or <i>seasons</i> of the year.</p>

<p>We find in the tablets translated by Epping
and Strassmaier the year “<i>beginning with Nisan,
hence in the spring</i>,” and this seems a more or
less natural season from which to count the year;
but when, taking the precession of the equinoxes
into account, we find that the year in Ḫammurabi’s
time (2,200 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>) must have commenced one month,
and in Sargon’s time (3,800 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>) two months
before the spring equinox, we feel surprised and
perplexed to find that the year must then have
begun without any reference to the seasons—the
four great and most easily observed divisions of
the ecliptic.</p>

<p>It is difficult to imagine that the astronomers
who so skilfully divided the ecliptic into its twelve
parts, and who originated the wonderful Accadian
calendar—a calendar so well thought out that, as
we have seen reason to believe, it resisted all the
shocks of time for nearly four thousand years—it
is difficult to imagine that such astronomers should
have taken no note of the four prominent divisions
of the year and of the ecliptic, <i>i.e.</i> the
solstices and the equinoxes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page13">[13]</span></p>

<p>There is, however, a way to account for this
anomaly, or, rather, there is a supposition which,
if adopted, will allow these astronomers of old to
have taken note, not only of the <i>months</i>, but also of
the <i>seasons</i> of the year, when first they drew up
their mighty scheme.</p>

<p>Let us suppose that the calendar which, as we
may learn from the astrological tablets, was already
in Sargon’s time a well known and venerated
institution, had been originally drawn up at a date
much earlier than Sargon’s, when the first month
(Bar zig-gar), was not the first <i>spring</i> month, but
when it was the first <i>winter</i> month of the year.
This date (see <a href="#PlateI">Plate I.</a>, <a href="#Fig1">fig. 1</a>) would have been about
6,000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>; for then the sun entered the constellation
Aries at the <i>winter solstice</i>—a season equally
well, if not better suited than the spring equinox
to hold the first place in the calendar.<a id="FNanchor8" href="#Footnote8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
Under this<span class="pagenum" id="Page14">[14]</span>
supposition, it would no longer be difficult to
imagine why the ancient Accadian astronomers
should have chosen Aries as the first constellation
of the Zodiac, and Nisan (Bar zig-gar) as the first
month, and the “beginning of the year.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote8" href="#FNanchor8" class="label">[8]</a> After this paper had appeared in the <i>Proceedings of the
Society of Biblical Archæology</i>, a corroboration of this opinion
occurred to the writer’s mind, suggested by a further study of the
month names in the Accadian calendar. It is as follows:—</p>

<p>The twelfth month is named “sowing of seed.” Seed may be
and is, sown in many latitudes in <i>spring</i>, and also in <i>winter</i>
time. “Sowing of seed” might therefore describe a month at
the ending of an equinoctial or of a solstitial year: but the thirteenth
(<i>i.e.</i> the occasionally intercalated) month is named that of “dark
sowing.” This epithet <i>dark</i>, added to the “sowing” of the
twelfth month, very plainly points to a solstitial or midwinter
ending of the year.</p>

<p>The thirteenth month in a luni-solar year, whose beginning
should be bound to the vernal equinox, must always cover some of
the concluding days of March and some of the first days of April;
and those days are certainly much <i>lighter, not darker</i> than those
of the preceding month, covering parts of February and March,
whereas, the thirteenth intercalary month in a luni-solar year, whose
beginning should be bound to the winter solstice, must always
cover the concluding days of December and those at the beginning
of January; and might well be distinguished by the epithet
<i>dark</i>, not only from the days of the preceding month, but indeed
from those of any other month of the year (see <a href="#PlateI">Plate I.</a>, <a href="#Fig1">figs. 1</a>,
<a href="#Fig2">2</a>.)</p>

<p>It is of interest here to note that this insistence in Accadian
month nomenclature on the darkness of the thirteenth month,
tends to confirm the already formed opinion of scholars, that the
Accadians were not indigenous to Babylonia, but had descended
into it from more northern latitudes, where darkness is a more
marked concomitant of winter than in the nearly tropical latitude
of Babylonia.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>Nor need we throw discredit on the early<span class="pagenum" id="Page15">[15]</span>
calendar makers 6,000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>, if we take for granted
that they were not acquainted with the fact that
slowly but inevitably the seasons must change their
position amongst the stars, and that, not knowing
this, they believed that in making the <i>beginning of
the year</i> dependent on the sun’s entry into the
<i>constellation Aries</i>, they were also binding it to the
<i>season of the winter solstice</i>.</p>

<p>As centuries rolled by, however, and slowly the
stars of Aries receded from the winter solstice,
Bar zig-gar was no longer the first month in the
sense of being the first winter month. Still, the
authority of the originators of the calendar held
sway; provision had been only made for counting
the year as a sidereal year; and Bar zig-gar, or
the month in which the sun entered Aries, was
still called the first month, and looked on as the
beginning of the year.</p>

<p>To carry out the reformation of any long established
calendar is, we know, not a trifling undertaking.
Even on secular grounds, any proposed
reform encounters strong opposition. But the
calendar in Babylonia was not only a civil, it was also
a religious, institution. Its origin was attributed<span class="pagenum" id="Page16">[16]</span>
to the Creator, and as the work of the Creator, it
is described in one of the old Babylonian tablets.<a id="FNanchor9" href="#Footnote9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>“For each of the twelve months <span class="smcap">He</span> fixed three
stars” (or groups of stars). “From the day when
the year issues forth to the close.”<a id="FNanchor10" href="#Footnote10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote10" href="#FNanchor10" class="label">[10]</a> In modern works we find the terms “useless,” “fanciful,”
and “inconvenient,” applied to the Zodiac and its constellations;
and for regulating a tropical year the constellations <i>are</i> “useless”
and “inconvenient,” but the theory that the reckoning of the
year and all its religious festivals depended on the observance
of the Zodiacal star-groups, would help to account for the widely
spread veneration in which they were held throughout so many
ages and by so many nations.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>The astronomical and astrological texts drawn
up for Sargon of Accad are entitled “The Illumination
of Bel,”<a id="FNanchor11" href="#Footnote11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> and still as late as the second century
<span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>, all Babylonian almanacs bore the heading:
“At the command of my Lord Bel and my Lady
Beltis, a decree.”<a id="FNanchor12" href="#Footnote12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Thus it was, we may suppose,
that under the protection of the gods the Accadian
calendar continued unchanged throughout all the
changing ages.</p>

<p>But during all the ages the winter solstice
moved on steadily through almost a quarter of
the great circle of the ecliptic,<a id="FNanchor13" href="#Footnote13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and in the second
century <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>, the <i>spring equinox</i> was not far from
the same point of the star-marked ecliptic where<span class="pagenum" id="Page18">[18]</span>
the <i>winter solstice</i> had been when first the
calendar-makers had “fixed” the constellations
“for the twelve months from the day when the
year issues forth to the close,” and we who now
read the almanacs drawn up at that late period of
Babylonian history are not (as has been said above)
surprised to find the year “<i>beginning with Nisan,
hence in the spring</i>.” (See <a href="#PlateI">Plate I.</a>, <a href="#Fig2">fig. 2</a>.)</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote13" href="#FNanchor13" class="label">[13]</a>
This moving of the equinoctial point through a <i>quarter</i> of
the great circle may perhaps explain the tradition to which
Syncellus twice alludes, once when he states that Eusebius was
aware of the Greek opinion that many ages, or rather myriads
of years had passed since the creation of the world, <i>during the
mythical retrograde movement of the Zodiac, from the beginning of
Aries, and its return again to the same point</i> (<i>Chronographia</i>, p. 17.)</p>

<p>And again at p. 52, he refers to “the return of the Zodiac to
its original position, according to the stories of the Greeks and
Egyptians, that is to say, the revolution from one point back again
to the same point, which is the first minute of the first division
of the equinoctial sign of the Zodiac, which is called κριος
(Aries) by them, as has been stated in the <i>Genica</i> of Hermes
and in the Cyrannid books.”</p>

<p>He goes on to say that this is the ground of the chronological
division of Claudius Ptolemy.</p>

<p>Jean Silvain Bailly, speaking of the Indian Zodiac, the beginning
of which is placed by the Brahmins at the first point of
Aries, suggests that a similar tradition may have prevailed amongst
the Indians and other ancient nations to account for the pre-eminence
so generally accorded to Aries. He says:</p>

<div class="quote">

<p>“Mais pourquoi ont-ils choisi cette constellation pour la
première? Il est évident que c’est une affaire de préjugé et de superstition;
le choix du premier point dans un cercle est arbitraire. Ils
auront été décidés par quelque ancienne tradition, telle par
example que celle que Muradi rapporte d’après Albumassar et
deux anciens livres égyptiens, où on lisoit que le monde avoit été
renouvellé après le déluge lorsque le soleil étoit au 1° du bélier,
régulus étant dans le colure des solstices. D’Herbelot ne parle
point de régulus; mais il dit que selon Albumassar les sept
planètes étoient en conjonction au premier point du bélier lors
de la création du monde. Cette tradition, sans doute fabuleuse,
qui venoit des mêmes préjugés que celle de Bérose, étoit asiatique.
Elle a pu suffire, ou telle autre du même genre, pour fonder la
préférence que les brames, ou les anciens en général, ont donnée
à la constellation du bélier, en l’établissant la première de leur
zodiaque. Ils ont cru que ce point du zodiaque étoit une
source de renouvellement, et ils ont dit que le zodiaque et
l’année se renouvelloient au même point où le monde s’étoit
régénéré.” (Bailly, <i>Histoire de l’Astronomie Ancienne</i>, pp. 482,
483.)</p>

<p>The propositions contained in this Paper are
these:—</p>

<p>I. The Accadian year was counted as a sidereal
year.</p>

<p>II. The Accadian calendar was first thought
out and originated at a date not later than 6,000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span></p>

<p>The first proposition is founded on the opinion,<span class="pagenum" id="Page19">[19]</span>
long ago expressed by many Oriental scholars, that
the Accadian months corresponded in very early
ages with the constellations of the Zodiac, Nisan—the
month during which the sun was in conjunction
with the constellation Aries—holding the first
place then, as also in the latest times of Babylonian
history, and, presumably, through the intervening
period.</p>

<p>But even if the first proposition is granted, the
second, it must be confessed, is only an opinion
based on the unlikelihood that the old Accadian
and sidereal year, otherwise so skilfully dealt with
in the calendar, should have begun, in what would
appear to be a haphazard manner, at no definite
season of the year.</p>

<p>It may seem that too much weight has been
attached in this Paper to what can only be called
a guess; but where there is so much that we
desire to know, and so little as yet absolutely
known of the early history of astronomy, the
temptation to make such guesses is great.</p>

<p>It is to their earliest heroes and to their gods
that the ancient heathen nations attributed the
invention of astronomy, and amongst the Jews<span class="pagenum" id="Page20">[20]</span>
also, according to Josephus, the children of Seth
were looked upon as being the first teachers of the
science.<a id="FNanchor14" href="#Footnote14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>Modern astronomers often speak in general
terms of their science as having existed in a
“hoar antiquity,” and in “prehistoric times.” But
questions as to when, and where it took its rise,
are still unanswered. During the last hundred
years these questions have been keenly discussed.
Babylon, Egypt, Greece, India, and China, have
each been claimed as “the cradle” of the science.
Some few writers (and prominent amongst them
Jean Silvain Bailly, a brilliant scholar and an
eminent astronomer) have contended for the view
that not by any one nation were the chief advances
in astronomy made, but that before the great races
of mankind separated from the parent stock, and
spread themselves over the globe, the phenomena
of astronomy had been closely observed, and
scientific methods for measuring time had been
adopted. Bailly speaks of “une astronomie perfectionnée,”
of which only “les débris” are to be
met with in possession of the civilized races of<span class="pagenum" id="Page21">[21]</span>
antiquity. He claims an antediluvian race as the
originators of astronomic science.</p>

<p>It may seem a bold suggestion to place the
formation of the calendar at a date so high as
6,000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>, a date exceeding as it does by 2,000
years that given to us in the margin of our Bibles
for the story of the fall of man and his expulsion
from Eden. It was in following Archbishop
Usher’s calculations that the date of 4,004 was
adopted and placed, where it still remains, in
our English Bibles. But the difficulty of determining
the early dates of Bible history has always
been felt to be very great, and “it is quite possible
to believe that Genesis gives us no certain data for
pronouncing on the time of man’s existence on the
earth.”<a id="FNanchor15" href="#Footnote15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Scholars, in basing their calculations on the
authority of Scripture, have arrived at very different
conclusions. Some only demand 3,616, others 6,984
years, as required from Scriptural sources for “the
years of the world to the birth of Christ.”<a id="FNanchor16" href="#Footnote16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>They are interesting as showing that even before archæological

<p>It will be seen that the earlier of these dates

THE CONSTELLATION ARIES</h3>

<p class="reprint">[Reprinted from the <i>Proceedings of the Society of Biblical
Archæology</i>, <i>March 1893</i>]</p>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>In the January number of the <i>Proceedings of
the Society of Biblical Archæology</i> for last year,
under the title <i>The Accadian Calendar</i>, two propositions
were advanced:—</p>

<p>I. The Accadian year was counted as a
sidereal year.</p>

<p>II. The Accadian calendar was first thought
out and originated at a date not later than 6,000
<span class="smcapall">B.C.</span></p>

<p>The fact that the sun’s entry into the constellation
Aries appears to have marked through
many millenniums the beginning of the Accadian
year, was cited in support of the first proposition,
and the fact that the sun’s entry into Aries coincided
about 6,000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span> with the winter solstice,
was relied on to support the probability of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page25">[25]</span>
second proposition, namely, that at the above date
the calendar, which so honoured the inconspicuous
constellation Aries, was first drawn up.</p>

<p>If we now find this inconspicuous part of the
heavens equally honoured by several nations in
very ancient times, we shall be led to think either
that these nations, independently of each other,
happened to observe and mark out the sun’s
annual course through the heavens at exactly the
same date, and therefore chose the same point as
marking the winter solstice; or we must suppose
that they derived their calendar and knowledge of
the Zodiac from observations originally made by
some <i>one</i> civilized race.</p>

<p>The Brahmins of India claim a high antiquity
for the science of astronomy in their country, and
their observations and calculations profess to date
back to the fourth millennium <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span> The names of
the Indian constellations are preserved to us in
the Sanscrit language, and these names are, so
to speak, identical with those that we use at the
present day when we speak of the figures of the
Zodiac. Many scholars of to-day believe that only
after Alexander’s conquests in India did the knowledge<span class="pagenum" id="Page26">[26]</span>
of the twelve-fold division of the Zodiac penetrate
into that country. Some, on the other hand,
maintain the opposite opinion, namely, “that the
names of the signs can be proved to have existed
in India at as early a period as in any other
country.”<a id="FNanchor17" href="#Footnote17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>Jean Silvain Bailly, whose opinions as to the
antiquity of the science of astronomy have been
already quoted in the foregoing Paper, in his work
on the history of ancient astronomy, speaking of
the Brahmins of India, the initial point of whose
Zodiac is at the first star in the constellation Aries,
writes as follows:<a id="FNanchor18" href="#Footnote18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>—</p>

<p>“Mais pourquoi ont-ils choisi cette constellation

The initial point of the Hindu Zodiac (see <a href="#PlateIII">Plate III.</a>) is about
9½ degrees to the west of the boundary line of the constellation
Aries, as it is drawn on our celestial globes. One foot of Aries,
however, extends beyond the boundary line, and touches a line
drawn through the initial point of the Hindu Zodiac and the
poles of the ecliptic. At <a href="#Page132">page 132</a>, the question of the date of the
fixation of this initial point is discussed, and a high antiquity for
it is claimed. There are many considerations which may lead us
to the opinion that not only in India, but amongst the ancients
generally, the first degree of the constellation coincided with the
Hindu initial point, and not with the boundary line of the constellation,
as it is now drawn. Greek and Latin authors, writing in
the first century <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>, speak of the solstitial and equinoctial
colures, as being “at the eighth degree of the Zodiac,” and these
statements, which have caused modern commentators much
perplexity (see <i>Handbuch der Klassischen Alterthumswissenschaft</i>;
<i>Zeitrechnung der Griechen und Römer</i>, Unger), may be
easily explained, if we realize that they, in all likelihood, counted
the degrees of the Zodiac from the same initial point as that in
use amongst Hindu astronomers, which in the first century <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>
was eight degrees to the west of the equinoctial point.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page27">[27]</span></p>

<p>Dupuis, writing at nearly the same date as
Bailly, about a hundred years ago, and in conflict
with him on many points relating to the Zodiac,
was also struck by the choice of this same inconspicuous
point in the great circle of the ecliptic,
not only by the Brahmins of India, but also by
other ancient nations. He further explains that
the difference in the choice of initial point by the
Chinese, and by the other nations, is only an apparent,
and not a real difference. On the wonderful
agreement shown by so many nations, in their
choice of the stars by which they marked the
beginning of their Zodiacs, Dupuis relied to<span class="pagenum" id="Page28">[28]</span>
support his views concerning the unity of the
astronomical and religious myths of all nations.</p>

<p>At the end of his work, <i>Mémoire Explicatif
du Zodiaque</i>, Dupuis gives in a diagram several
Zodiacs in concentric circles; some divided into
twelve, some into twenty-seven or twenty-eight
parts. He represents the colures by a cross
which quarters these concentric Zodiacs, and
speaking of the twenty-seven- and twenty-eight-fold
divisions, he observes as follows:</p>

<div class="quote">

<p>“On remarque d’abord, que ces divers systèmes
lunaires, tirés de l’Astronomie de différens peuples,
s’accordent tous à placer dans les cases correspondantes
à-peu-près les mêmes étoiles. Il suffit, pour
s’en assurer, de comparer les étoiles designées dans
la même case de la division de chaque peuple.
On remarque aussi qu’ils ont pris tous, excepté
les Chinois, les mêmes étoiles, pour point initial de
la division, savoir, celles de la tête du Bélier. Les
Chinois, au contraire, ont fixé le point initial dans
la partie du ciel diamétralement opposée, vers les
pieds de la Vierge et près l’Epi” (p. 4).</p>

</div><!--quote-->

<p>Dupuis’ arguments, drawn from the choice by
several nations of the first division of Aries as
the initial point of the Zodiac and year, are of<span class="pagenum" id="Page29">[29]</span>
equal cogency in support of a calendar such as he
suggests, drawn up more than 12,000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>, for a
year beginning at the <i>autumn equinox</i>; or for
a calendar, as suggested in this Paper, drawn up
about 6,000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>, and dealing with a year beginning
at the <i>winter solstice</i>; and it may be claimed
that the facts brought to light by the study of
the ancient Accadian calendar, while greatly
strengthening the ground for Dupuis’ opinion concerning
the early acceptance by many nations of the
stars of Aries as a mark for the beginning of the year
in prehistoric times, seem more in favour of the
first month of that year having been counted from
the <i>winter solstice</i> than from the <i>autumn equinox</i>.</p>

<p>Quotations from authors like Bailly and Dupuis
may seem nowadays somewhat out of date; for
though they were amongst the foremost scholars
of their time, they were necessarily ignorant of
all the archæological discoveries that have succeeded
each other with such rapidity during the
last century. Unless, therefore, the brilliant guesses
and astronomical speculations of these writers can
find confirmation in the results of modern researches,
their theories may well be disregarded.<span class="pagenum" id="Page30">[30]</span>
But it seems to me that many of their theories
are meeting with such confirmation.</p>

<p>Turning first to some of the facts which
archæology has taught us regarding the ancient
Egyptians, it will be interesting to see if there are
any indications in their astronomy or mythology of
honour paid to the constellation Aries in connexion
with the progress of the sun and moon through
the figures of the Zodiac.</p>

<p>It is true that the acquaintance of the ancient
Egyptians with these figures is a matter still in
dispute, and the various methods of counting the
year followed by them also present great difficulties
to scholars. It is, however, admitted that they
were a people much given to the observation and
worship of the heavenly bodies, and that their
astronomy and mythology were very closely
interwoven with each other.</p>

<p>In the time of the Middle Empire, it seems,
the months in the civil year were not counted
as lunar months, but as months of thirty days
each. The year was not counted as a sidereal
year, but as one of three hundred and sixty days—twelve
months of thirty days—with five days<span class="pagenum" id="Page31">[31]</span>
added at the end of each year to bring up the
number to three hundred and sixty-five days. No
attention was paid to the odd hours and minutes
over and above the three hundred and sixty-five
days, which are occupied by the sun in completing
his annual course.</p>

<p>Mr Griffiths has remarked in the number of
the <i>Proceedings of the Society of Biblical
Archæology</i> for March 1892, that the hieroglyph
for month points to an <i>originally</i> lunar month,
and I would suggest that the star under the
first crescent seems to point also to a month
originally counted sidereally, <i>i.e.</i>, dependent upon
the conjunction of the sun and moon in some
particular star-group of the ecliptic. As a matter
of fact, the Egyptians made use not only of a civil
year such as has been above described, but also of
a sidereal year, counted from the heliacal rising of
Sirius, and it is perhaps possible that the months
in this sidereal year were counted as lunar months,
and the year treated as soli-lunar and sidereal.</p>

<p>In these two Egyptian <i>calendars</i>—so far as
they are at present understood—no reference to
the constellation Aries seems to be discernible.<span class="pagenum" id="Page32">[32]</span>
The agricultural importance of the season of the
summer solstice in Egypt, coinciding as it does with
the rising of the Nile, may have induced calendar-makers
at some very early date to re-arrange the
order of the year, so as to make it begin at the
<i>summer</i> rather than the <i>winter</i> solstice—the season,
as it is contended in these Papers, originally chosen
6,000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span> by astronomers in a more northern
latitude than that of Egypt as the starting-point
of a year sidereally marked by the conjunction of
the sun with the constellation Aries.</p>

<p>But if we turn to the Egyptian <i>mythology</i>, the
importance of the Ram, or rather of the head of the
Ram, as it is revealed in the monuments, and in the
pictorial art of the ancient Egyptians, must continually
strike the student of Egyptian symbolism.</p>

<p>Amen, the great god of the Theban triad
(Amen, Maut, and Chons), is sometimes represented
as ram-headed—his boat and his sceptre are always
adorned with a ram’s head, and the great temple
to him, in conjunction with the sun, <i>i.e.</i> to
Amen-Ra, is approached through an avenue of
gigantic ram-headed sphinxes, and this is also
the case as regards the temple of Chons—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page33">[33]</span>
moon-god—at right angles, and in close proximity,
to the great temple of Amen-Ra.</p>

<p>Scholars tell us that Horus, Isis, and Osiris,—the
Memphian triad—symbolized the <i>diurnal</i>
motion of the sun and other heavenly bodies,
and it need not appear improbable that the great
Theban triad, Amen, Maut, and Chons, should
have originally symbolized the <i>annual</i> course
of those same bodies through the constellations
of the Zodiac. This would account for the prominence
of the Ram in connexion with the worship
of this triad—the Ram, which, as I have argued,
in many countries, and possibly in Egypt also,
marked the first division of the Zodiac and year.</p>

<p>A prayer to Amen is translated by G. Maspero
in the April number for 1891 of the <i>Proceedings
of the Society of Biblical Archæology</i>;<a id="FNanchor19" href="#Footnote19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> from this
translation it would appear that Amen is implored
to bring the calendar into touch with the real
seasons of the year. If Amen represented a<span class="pagenum" id="Page34">[34]</span>
sidereally marked point in the yearly course of
the sun, such a prayer might suitably have been
addressed to him by the Egyptians.</p>

<p>The great temple to Amen-Ra at Thebes,
approached, as has been stated above, through
an avenue of ram-headed sphinxes, is oriented
to the setting sun of the season so important to
Egyptians, that of the summer solstice, and this
fact strengthens the opinion that Amen was
considered to be a god in some way presiding
over the course of the year and its right
measurement. It is true that this orientation
of his temple precluded the possibility of the
light from any star of the constellation Aries
ever shining into the shrine of the god; but it is
perhaps possible that the ceremony of “the great<span class="pagenum" id="Page35">[35]</span>
feast-day of Amon Father,” described by Ebers,
may have been devised by the votaries of Amen
as a means whereby they could honour the god,
as one presiding over the most propitious season
of the year, and also recall the sidereal connexion
of the god of the year with the, from times immemorial
highly reverenced, constellation Aries.</p>

<p>At pp. 277 and 278 of <i>Egypt, Descriptive,
Historical, and Picturesque</i>, vol. ii., Ebers, having
referred to some figures represented on the walls
of a Memnonium in the Nekropolis erected by
Rameses II., exactly opposite to the Great Temple
of Karnak, observes:—</p>

<div class="quote">

<p>“Of these figures the inscription says:—‘As
they approach the king their arms are filled with
choice produce and stores, and all the good things
that the earth brings forth are gathered by them
to add to the joy on the great feast-day of Amon,
the father.’”</p>

<p>“These words refer to the great ‘feast of the
Valley’ (<i>heb en-ant</i>), when, on the 29th day of the
second month of the inundation, the statue of Amon
was brought forth from the sanctuary with much
magnificence and solemnity, and conveyed across
the Nile to the Nekropolis, that the god might there<span class="pagenum" id="Page36">[36]</span>
offer sacrifices to his ancestors in the other world.
The priests of the house of Seti received the procession
with the splendid bark Sam, the most sacred
of all the vessels that were preserved in the temple of
Karnak: in this the statue of the god was placed, and
borne first to the Memnonium of Seti, and then round
about the Nekropolis, preceded by a crowd of temple
servants, who strewed the way with sand. The
solemnities ended with a grand nocturnal spectacle,
on the great sacred lake of which traces may still
be seen to the extreme south of the Nekropolis.</p>

<p>“The Egyptian religion prescribed to all its
followers that they should visit the tombs of their
dead and bring offerings, in grateful remembrance
of their parents and forefathers; and as, day after
day, millions of suns had gone to rest—as men do—behind
the realm of tombs in the Libyan hills,
the god himself was brought to do honour to his
departed ancestry, and to sacrifice to them.”</p>

</div><!--quote-->

<p>The rising of the Nile in Egypt coincides very
closely with the season of the <i>summer solstice</i>.
At the date of Rameses II.—a date not yet
unanimously agreed on by scholars, but which
may be safely placed between 1,400 and 1,100 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>—the
sun at the season of the <i>summer solstice</i> was
in the constellation Cancer (see <a href="#PlateII">Plate II.</a>), and<span class="pagenum" id="Page37">[37]</span>
two months later its place in the ecliptic was a
few degrees to the west of a point exactly opposed
to the first stars of Aries and to the initial
point of the Indian Zodiac. On the evening,
therefore, of the 29th day of the second month
of the inundation, when the sun had now sunk
behind the Libyan hills, and daylight had faded
sufficiently to allow them to show their light,<a id="FNanchor20" href="#Footnote20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
the first stars of Aries rose above the eastern
horizon, and at midnight attained to the southern
meridian.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote20" href="#FNanchor20" class="label">[20]</a> When the sun is about 7° below the western horizon, stars in
the opposite quarter of the heavens begin to be visible.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>Thus at the season of all the year, when
Aries specially dominated the ecliptic, the statue
of the god Amen was, as we learn, brought
out of his dark temple shrine and carried in
procession to the Nekropolis, from whence the
constellation Aries—not hidden by obstructing
walls and columns—was fully visible; and there
honour was done and sacrifice offered to “Amon
Father.”</p>

<p>But it may be said that we should understand
“the second month of the inundation”<span class="pagenum" id="Page38">[38]</span>
to refer to the second month of the Egyptian
sidereal year counted from the 1st Thoth
(fixed) and marked by the heliacal rising of
Sirius. At the date of Rameses the beginning
of this sidereal year fell, as may be proved, a
fortnight after the <i>summer solstice</i> (see <a href="#PlateII">Plate II.</a>),
and still on the 29th of the second month
of this sidereal year the stars of Aries might
be seen rising in the east—no longer only its
first stars, but nearly the whole constellation then
becoming visible—and at about midnight its
brightest stars, α and β Arietis, culminated on
the meridian. Whether, therefore, the “Feast
of the Valley” was held at the end of the
second month of the actual inundation, or of
the second month of the sidereal year, the
stars of Aries presided over its “nocturnal”
solemnities.</p>

<p>Some scholars claim, however, that all Egyptian
festivals were swept round through the seasons,
and the stars that marked those seasons, in the
course of fourteen or fifteen hundred years, inasmuch
as they were firmly bound to the <i>vague</i>
calendrical year of 365 days. If this was indeed<span class="pagenum" id="Page39">[39]</span>
so, it would be difficult to imagine that Seti I. or
Rameses II. could have established the festival
in question as in any way connected with honour
to be paid to the constellation Aries; for though
during the reign of Seti, and perhaps during the
early part of that of Rameses, the vague and
fixed years coincided more or less closely (see
<a href="#PlateII">Plate II.</a>), yet before the death of Rameses they
were already so far apart that the 1st Thoth
(vague) fell, not a fortnight later than the summer
solstice, but about a fortnight earlier; and therefore
on the 29th day of the second month of the
vague year the stars of Aries would not have
risen until long after sunset, nor would any one
of them have culminated on the meridian at
midnight.</p>

<p>If now we turn our attention of the temple
of Amen-Ra at Aboo Simbel, we may observe
that, unlike that to the same god at Karnak,
it is not oriented to any definite <i>season</i> of the
year. The rising sun shines into it now, and
must always have shone into the Holy of Holies
of that rock-hewn temple on the morning of a
day somewhat more than two months distant<span class="pagenum" id="Page40">[40]</span>
from the winter solstice, and somewhat less than
a month before the season of the spring equinox,
namely, on the morning of the 26th February
(Gregorian).<a id="FNanchor21" href="#Footnote21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote21" href="#FNanchor21" class="label">[21]</a> “I was fortunate in seeing another wonderful thing during
my visit to Aboo Simbel. The great temple is dedicated to
Amen-Ra, the sun-god, and on two days in the year the sun is
said to rise at such a point that it sends a beam of light through
both halls till it falls on the shrine itself in the very Holy of
Holies. Many theories are based on the orientation of the
temples, and Captain Johnston wished to find on which day
in the spring of the year the phenomenon took place; so he
took his instruments, and we all went up to the temple before
dawn. It was the 26th February. The great hall, with its
eight Osiride pillars, was wrapped in semi-darkness. Still darker
were the inner hall and shrine. Behind the altar sat the four
gods, Amen, Horus, Ptah, and Rameses himself, now deified.
All the East was a deep rosy flush; then that paled, and
a hard white light filled the sky. Clearer and whiter it grew,
till, with a sudden joyous rush, the sun swung up over the
low ridge of hill, and in an instant, like an arrow from the
bow of Phœbus Apollo, one level shaft of light pierced
the great hall and fell in living glory straight upon the shrine
itself.”—A. F. [Extract from the <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>, 20th
April, 1892.]</p>


</div><!--footnote-->

<p>The sun now (1893 <span class="smcapall">A.D.</span>) is, at the season named,
in the constellation Aquarius; but if we calculate
back to a date anywhere between 1,400 and
1,100 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>, we shall find (see <a href="#PlateIII">Plate III.</a>) that
when Rameses II. dedicated this temple to<span class="pagenum" id="Page41">[41]</span>
Amen-Ra, the sun when it penetrated into the
shrine of the temple at Aboo Simbel was in
conjunction with the first stars of the constellation
<i>Aries</i>, and this fact must, it would seem,
encourage us to adopt the opinion put forward
above concerning the desire of Rameses II. to
honour that constellation in connexion with the
god Amen.</p>

<p>It would seem then that there are indications
in the mythology and in the history of the
Egyptians, of honour paid to the constellation
Aries, and as we further study the records of
antiquity, now within our reach, it will, I believe,
become evident that not only the Egyptians, but
also all the great civilized nations of the East,
had traditions of a year beginning when the sun
and moon entered the constellation Aries—such a
year as that in use amongst the Babylonians during
their long existence as a nation, and such as that
which is used by the Hindus in India to this
present day.</p>

<p>If we allow weight to these considerations, it
will be difficult to think that such a method of
reckoning the year—involving, as it did, the recognition<span class="pagenum" id="Page42">[42]</span>
of the ecliptic star-groups under the fanciful
figures of the Zodiac—should have been arrived at
by each of these nations independently. Whether
one nation borrowed these ideas from another, or
whether some “earlier race of men” bequeathed
this knowledge to their many descendants, is still an
open question. Scholars have not unanimously
awarded the palm of seniority in civilization to any
one nation, and we are not at variance with proved
facts, if we elect to adopt the theory of a common
stock, from which the divergent races sprang. If,
then, it should appear that these races possessed and
incorporated into their mythologies a knowledge
of the Zodiac, and of the first degree of Aries
as its initial point, their separation from the parent
stock must have been subsequent to the formation
of the scheme that dealt with a calendar based on
an observation of the colure of the winter solstice
at that point, and under this supposition the date of
6,000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span> becomes a foothold for the chronology of
ancient history. We should also be led to think of
the common ancestors of the civilized races not as
ignorant barbarians, but rather as men graced with
high intellectual gifts—men whose teachings have<span class="pagenum" id="Page43">[43]</span>
been handed down through all the ages to this
present day, and of whose imaginings the Zodiac
remains as the most ancient monument of the work
of intelligent man.</p>

and <i>Namen der Sterne</i>, pp. 174, 175, the
twelve abbreviations met with in the tablets are
discussed at some length.</p>

<p>From a study of the list here given and of
the passages referred to, we learn that it has been
found possible to suggest for some of the abbreviations
suitable terminations, and in the completed
words thus obtained, the familiar constellations of
the Zodiac, as we know them, are easily to be
recognized.</p>

<p>As regards other of the abbreviations, and
amongst them that of <img src="images/illo064a.jpg" alt="Gu" class="cuneiform"> (Gu) for the eleventh
sign (Amphora or Aquarius), no termination has
been suggested; and of it Strassmaier thus writes:<a id="FNanchor23" href="#Footnote23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
p. 171:—“Gu ist sonst fast ausschliesslich nur
als Silbenzeichen gu bekannt”; and Jensen, discussing
Epping and Strassmaier’s constellation
list, writes thus of the abbreviation Gu for the
eleventh constellation:<a id="FNanchor24" href="#Footnote24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
“Ob Gu einen ‘Wassereimer,’<span class="pagenum" id="Page46">[46]</span>
‘Schöpfeimer,’ bezeichnen kann, weiss ich
nicht. Die bisher veröffentlichten Texte geben
keinen Aufschluss darüber.”</p>

<p>As a probable completion for the abbreviation
Gu, the following suggestion is here put forward:—</p>

<p>In the ancient astrological tablets translated
by Professor Sayce in his Paper, <i>The Astronomy
and Astrology of the Babylonians</i>,<a id="FNanchor25" href="#Footnote25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> pp. 189, 190,
“the star of Gula” is mentioned. The first syllable
of this word is composed of the same cuneiform
group as that used in the abbreviation for the
eleventh constellation of the Zodiac in the astronomical
tablets of the first and second centuries <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>
above referred to. But this fact, if it stood alone,
would not be enough to do more than point
to a possible identification of Gu in the late
tablets with Gula in the ancient astrological works.
Amongst the many constellations in the heavens
the name of more than one might have begun
with the syllable Gu.</p>

<p>We find, however, at a later page (206) of
Professor Sayce’s Paper, this sentence translated
from W.A.I., III. 57, 1:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page47">[47]</span></p>

<p>“Jupiter<a id="FNanchor26" href="#Footnote26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> in the star of Gula lingers.” None of
the five planets known to the Babylonians could ever
with truth have been described as appearing or
“lingering” in any part of the heavens outside
the band of the Zodiac stars. “The star (or constellation)
of Gula,” we must therefore assume, was
a Zodiacal star or constellation. This restriction
of the position of the “star of Gula” renders it
scarcely a rash conclusion to arrive at, that the
<i>Zodiacal</i> Gu of the later tablets is an abbreviation
for the <i>Zodiacal</i> Gula of the ancient astrological
works.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>As to a mythological reason for the choice
of the goddess Gula to preside over the constellation
known to us as Aquarius, we find it in the fact
that Gula appears as another name for the goddess
Bau<a id="FNanchor27" href="#Footnote27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> and Bau (or Bahu) was a personification
of <i>the dark water</i>, or chaos.</p>

<p>If we adopt this identification of the star or
constellation Gula with the constellation, or some
star in the constellation, Aquarius, it will throw light<span class="pagenum" id="Page48">[48]</span>
on many of the inscriptions found on statues and
other monuments at Telloh (the modern name of
the mound which covers the ruins of the ancient
city of Lagash),</p>

<p>We find from these inscriptions that the deities
especially worshipped at Lagash were not the same
as those who held the foremost places contemporaneously
in the Accadian, and at a later time
in the Babylonian Pantheon. Ningirsu and “his
beloved consort,” the goddess Bau, received in
Lagash the highest honours. On one of the
statues of Gudea, “the priestly governor of Lagash,”
this inscription occurs:<a id="FNanchor28" href="#Footnote28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>—</p>

<div class="quote">

<p>“To Ningirsu, the powerful warrior of Ellilla
[this is dedicated] by Gudea, priestly governor of
Lagash, who has constructed the temple of Eninnu,
consecrated to Ningirsu.</p>

<p>“For Ningirsu, his lord, he has built the temple
of Ekhud, the tower in stages, from the summit of
which Ningirsu grants him a happy lot.</p>

<p>“Besides the offerings which Gudea made of his
free will to Ningirsu and to the goddess Bau,
daughter of Anna, his beloved consort, he has made
others to his god Ningiszida.</p>

<p>“That year he had a block of rare stone brought
from the country of Magan; he had it carved into a
statue of himself.</p>

<p>“On the day of the beginning of the year, the
day of the festival of Bau, on which offerings were
made: one calf, one fat sheep, three lambs, six full
grown sheep, two rams, seven <i>pat</i> of dates, seven

<p>Ningirsu, the god—so highly exalted in this
and in other inscriptions found in the mounds of
Telloh—has been identified with the god Ninib<a id="FNanchor29" href="#Footnote29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> of
the Babylonians. Much difference of opinion prevails
as to what astronomical ideas were connected
by the ancient inhabitants of Mesopotamia with the
god Ninib.</p>

<p>Jensen admits that the generally received opinion
as to Ninib is that he represents the “southern
sun.”<a id="FNanchor30" href="#Footnote30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> He, however, contends, with great eagerness,
that this is a mistaken opinion, and that Ninib
is really the eastern or rising sun. Many of Jensen’s
arguments against the possibility of Ninib<span class="pagenum" id="Page50">[50]</span>
representing the southern sun are based on the
assumption that the epithet “southern,” applied to
the sun, denotes the power of the mid-day sun;
whereas, in other descriptions of Ninib, he appears
as struggling with, though in the end triumphant
over, storm, and cloud, and darkness.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote30" href="#FNanchor30" class="label">[30]</a> Jensen, <i>Die Kosmologie der Babylonier</i>, p. 460.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>The sun in his <i>daily</i> course attains the southern
meridian at noon, and that may well be described
by Jensen as the “alles verzehrenden und versengenden
Süd- oder Mittagssonne,” but if we think
of the sun in his <i>annual</i> course, the words “southern
sun” may more fitly in an astronomical sense mean
the struggling and finally triumphant sun of the
winter solstice. And if we so understand the expression,
the apparently contradictory references to
Ninib are easily explained.</p>

<p>At mid-winter the sun rises and sets more to
the south than at any other time of the year; at
noon on the day of the winter solstice the sun is
forty-seven degrees nearer to the south pole of the
heavens than it is at the summer solstice.</p>

<p>If, instead of adopting Jensen’s contention, and
looking upon Ninib as the eastern rising sun, we
revert to the generally held opinion that Ninib was<span class="pagenum" id="Page51">[51]</span>
the god of the southern sun, and if we understand
the southern sun in its astronomical sense as the
winter, or more strictly speaking the mid-winter
sun, it will naturally lead us to the conclusion that
“the day of the beginning of the year,” the day
of the festival of Bau, Ningirsu’s (= Ninib’s) “beloved
consort,” was held at the time of the winter
solstice.</p>

<p>Speaking in round numbers, from 4,000 to 2,000
<span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>, the winter solstice took place when the sun
was in conjunction with the constellation Aquarius,
which constellation, or some one of its stars, was,
as has been suggested, called by the Babylonian
astronomers, Gula, Gula being another name for Bau.</p>

<p>It is not therefore surprising to find that those
rulers of Lagash, whose dates fell between 4,000
and 2,000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>, should have so often associated
together Ningirsu and Bau; and further, that
Gudea, whose rule is placed at about 2,900 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>,
should on “the day of the beginning of the year”
have kept high festival in honour of Bau, as the
beneficent deity presiding in conjunction with Ningirsu
over the revolving years.</p>

<p>The precession of the equinoxes must necessarily<span class="pagenum" id="Page52">[52]</span>
in the course of ages introduce confusion
into all Zodiacal calendars, and into all ritual and
mythological symbolism founded on such calendars.
From 2,000 b.c. down to the beginning of our era,
the winter solstice took place when the sun was
in conjunction with Capricornus, not with Aquarius.
In those later days, if the inhabitants of Lagash still
celebrated their new year’s festival at the winter
solstice, Bau (= Gula = Aquarius) could only have
laid a traditional claim to preside over it.</p>

<p>In accordance with these astronomical facts, we
learn from the teachings of the tablets that the
especial reverence paid to Bau = Gula, in the
Lagash inscriptions was not extended to her in
later times.</p>

<p>As to Ninib, we know that even at Gudea’s
date in the neighbouring state of Accad, and in
later times in Babylon, he did not hold the pre-eminent
position accorded to him by the early rulers
of Lagash.</p>

<p>This difference in the religious observances of
Accad and Lagash regarding Ninib—if we suppose
him to be the god of the winter solstice—may also
receive an astronomical explanation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page53">[53]</span></p>

<p>According to the evidence of <i>The Standard
Astrological Work</i>, the compilation of which is
generally attributed to the date 3,800 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>, and
according to the evidence of many other tablets,
the year in Accad and afterwards in Babylon began
not at the winter solstice, but on the 1st day of
Nisan, and Nisan (Acc. Bar zig-gar), the month
of “the sacrifice of righteousness,” was, as its name
suggests, the month during which the sun was in
conjunction with the constellation Aries.</p>

<p>At Gudea’s date, about 2,900 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>, the 1st of
Nisan, if it was dependent on the sun’s entry
into Aries, must have fallen about midway between
the winter solstice and the spring equinox, and as
century succeeded century, the 1st of Nisan must
slowly but surely have receded further from the
solstice and have approached more and more to the
equinoctial point.</p>

<p>In Accad, therefore, neither at Gudea’s nor at
any later date, did the year begin at the winter
solstice, and hence we can understand why in that
state, and afterwards in Babylon, Ninib was not as
highly honoured as in Lagash, and why he and
his consort Bau (= Gula) were not referred to as<span class="pagenum" id="Page54">[54]</span>
the deities presiding over the beginning of the
year.</p>

<p>In a former number of these <i>Proceedings</i><a id="FNanchor31" href="#Footnote31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> I
drew attention to the Accadian calendar. It was
there suggested that the choice of the first degree
of Aries as the initial point of the Zodiac was
originally made when the winter solstice coincided
with the sun’s entry into that constellation, <i>i.e.</i>
about 6,000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span></p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>If that suggestion, and the present one concerning
the new year’s festival in Lagash are
accepted, it will be easy to imagine that the
Lagash observance betokened a sort of effort to
reform the sidereal calendar in use in Accad, and
it may be elsewhere.</p>

<p>In Accad the calendar makers clung to the
originally instituted <i>star-mark</i> for the year, and
made it begin with the sun’s entry into Aries;
therefore by degrees the beginning of their year
moved away from the winter solstice, and in the
first century <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span> coincided very closely with the
spring equinox.</p>

<p>In Lagash, on the contrary, the calendar makers<span class="pagenum" id="Page55">[55]</span>
clung to the originally established <i>season</i> of the
year, and made it begin at the winter solstice;
therefore by degrees the beginning of their year
moved away from the constellation Aries, and in
Gudea’s time the new year’s festival was held in
honour of the goddess Bau = Gula = Aquarius.</p>

<p>I now desire to draw attention to the Median
calendar, which appears to have differed from
that used, as above suggested, in Accad or in
Lagash; inasmuch as the beginning of the Median
year was not dependent on the sun’s entry into
the <i>constellation Aries</i>, as in Accad; nor was it
fixed to the season of the <i>winter solstice</i> as in
Lagash.</p>

<p>The beginning of the Median year was fixed
to the <i>season of the spring equinox</i>, and remaining
true to that season, followed no star-mark.
The great importance, however, of Tauric symbolism
in Median art seems to point to the fact
that <i>when the equinoctial year was first established</i>
the spring equinoctial point was in the constellation
Taurus. Astronomy teaches us that was the
case, speaking in round numbers, from 4,000 to
2,000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.<span class="pagenum" id="Page58">[58]</span></span></p>

<p>It is true that we have no documentary proof
of the existence of a Median <i>equinoctial</i> calendar in
the remote past, such as that which we possess in
the Babylonian standard astrological works regarding
the ancient <i>sidereal</i> Accadian calendar.
We have, however, among the modern representatives
of the Medes, the Persians, a very
distinctive calendrical observance, namely, that of
the Nowroose, or the festival of the new year;
and we have the Persian tradition that the institution
of this festival was of fabulous antiquity. I
quote from Ker Porter’s remarks on this subject:—</p>

<div class="quote">

<p>“The 21st of March, the impatiently anticipated
day of the most joyous festival of Persia,
at last arrived. It is called the feast of the Nowroose,
or that of the commencement of the new
year; and its institution is attributed to the celebrated
Jemsheed, who, according to the traditions
of the country, and the fragments yet preserved
of its early native historians, was the sixth in
descent from Noah, and the fourth sovereign of
Persia, of the race of Kaiomurs, the grandson
of Noah.... But to return to the feast of the
Nowroose. It is acknowledged to have been celebrated
from the earliest ages, in Persia, independent<span class="pagenum" id="Page59">[59]</span>
of whatever religions reigned there; whether
the simple worship of the One Great Being, or
under the successive rites of Magian, Pagan, or
Mahomedan institutions.” (<i>Travels</i>, vol. i. p. 316.)</p>

</div><!--quote-->

<p>This equinoctial and solar year, as the writer
proceeds to point out, is adhered to by the Persians,
though they, being Mahomedans, also celebrate
Mahomedan lunar festivals, and for many
purposes make use of the Mahomedan lunar
year.</p>

<p>It is easy to see how greatly the Persian Nowroose
differs from the purely lunar Mahomedan
anniversaries—anniversaries which in the course
of about thirty-two and a half years necessarily
make a complete circuit through the seasons. The
difference, though not so marked, which exists
between the purely solar Nowroose, and all
soli-lunar festivals, such as those of the Babylonians,
should also be taken note of. These last,
like our Easter, were dependent on the phases of
the moon, and were therefore “moveable.” The
Persian Nowroose, like our Christmas Day, is an
“immoveable” festival—fixed to the day of the
spring equinox.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page60">[60]</span></p>

<p>Modern tradition concerning the distinctively
Persian custom of celebrating the Nowroose would,
if it stood alone, furnish very slight grounds on
which to found a far-reaching theory; but historical
evidence confirms this tradition to a great extent,
by teaching us that the Median and Persian worshippers
of Ahura Mazda, and of Mithras, certainly
under the Sassinide dynasty, and almost with
equal certainty under the Achæmenid kings, kept
their calendar and celebrated their religious festivals
in a manner differing from that of the surrounding
nations; their months were not lunar,
their years were not soli-lunar but distinctly solar,
and the spring equinox was the date to which as
closely as possible the beginning of their year was
fixed.</p>

<p>In Darmesteter’s translation of the <i>Zend Avesta</i>
the Persian months are treated of in Appendix C,
p. 33, and in Appendix D, p. 37, we read of the
Persian years:—</p>

<div class="quote">

<p>“L’année était divisée en quatre saisons, correspondant
aux nôtres. Cette division ne paraît guère
que dans les textes post-avestéens; mais il y a dans
l’Avesta même des traces de son existence ancienne.<span class="pagenum" id="Page61">[61]</span>
La division normale de l’année est, dans l’Avesta,
en deux saisons, été et hiver; l’été, <i>hama</i>, qui comprend
les sept premiers mois (du 1<sup>er</sup> Farvardîn au
30 Mihr, soit du 21 mars au 16 octobre)....
Cette division a une valeur religieuse, non seulement
pour le rituel, mais aussi pour les pratiques,
qui varient selon la saison.”</p>

</div><!--quote-->

<p>The worship of the Persian sun-god Mithras
was introduced into Rome about the time of the
fall of the Republic. How far this worship differed
from that taught in the Zoroastrian writings we need
not inquire; however changed it may have been,
it was evidently derived originally from a Persian
or a Median source. The worship of Mithras, in
spite of much opposition, gained many followers in
Rome. The birthday of the sun-god was kept at
the winter solstice, but the great festivities in his
honour, “<i>the mysteries of Mithras</i>,” were as a rule
celebrated at the season of the spring
equinox,<a id="FNanchor33" href="#Footnote33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page62">[62]</span>
and were famous even among Roman festivals.
Let us now turn our attention to the Tauric symbolism
so closely connected with Mithraic observances
in Rome.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote33" href="#FNanchor33" class="label">[33]</a>
Cumont, in the first volume of his <i>Monuments figurés relatifs
aux mystères de Mithra</i>, p. 326, having spoken of the solstitial
festival in honour of the birthday of the god, observes as follows:
“Nous avons certaines raisons de croire que les équinoxes étaient
aussi des jours fériés où l’on inaugurait par quelque salutation le
retour des Saisons divinisées. Les initiations avaient lieu de préférence
vers le début du printemps, en mars ou en avril....”</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<div class="quote">

<p>A writer in the <i>Athenæum</i> thus describes a
Roman Mithræum:<a id="FNanchor34" href="#Footnote34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> “Discovery was made during
some excavations at Ostia of a handsome house
containing among its various rooms a <i>mithræum</i>....
Into the kitchen opens a narrow and tortuous
passage, from which by a small half-concealed staircase
the <i>mithræum</i> is reached; ... it is quadrangular
and regular in shape, as is usually the case
in buildings of the kind. Almost the whole length
of the two lateral walls run two seats, and on the
side opposite the door is seen a little elevation,
which served as the place for the usual statue of
Mithras in the act of thrusting his dagger into the
neck of the mystic Bull. A very singular peculiarity
of this little Ostian <i>mithræum</i> is that it is
entirely covered with mosaics—pavements, seats,
and walls alike. The various figures and the
symbols are splendidly drawn, and all executed in
black <i>tesseræ</i> on a white ground. Upon each side
of the seats, turned to the entrance door, is figured
a genius bearing a lamp, that is, the genius of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page63">[63]</span>
spring equinox, with the face raised, and that of
the autumn equinox, with the face cast down....
It is known, in fact, that the whole myth of Mithras
is related to the phases of the sun ... hence are
represented in the ground below the seats all the
twelve signs of the zodiac, by means of the usual
symbols, but each accompanied by a large star.”</p>

<p><a id="Footnote34" href="#FNanchor34" class="label">[34]</a> <i>Athenæum</i>, 1886, October 30 and November 6.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>In the many sculptures of the Mithras group
similar to that above described, which have been
so well figured in Lajard’s <i>Culte de Mithras</i>,
various heavenly bodies are represented. The
Scorpion (the constellation Scorpio of the Zodiac
opposed to Taurus) joins with Mithras in his attack
upon the Bull, and always the genii of the spring
and autumn equinoxes are present in joyous and
mournful attitudes.</p>

<p>In looking at these plates the conviction is
clearly forced upon our minds that the Bull so persistently,
and, it may be added, so serenely, slain
by Mithras in these Roman representations, is the
Zodiacal Bull, overcome, and as it were destroyed
or banished from heaven, in the daytime by the
sun-god, and at night by Scorpio, the constellation
in opposition. With almost equal conviction we<span class="pagenum" id="Page64">[64]</span>
arrive at the conclusion that this triumph of Mithras
was associated traditionally—in Roman days it
could only have been traditionally—with the occurrence,
at a remote date, of the spring equinox
during the time that the sun was in conjunction
with the constellation Taurus.</p>

<p>In the ruins of Persepolis, ruins of buildings
designed, erected, and decorated by the worshippers
of the supreme God Ahura Mazda, and of his
friend and representative Mithras, Tauric symbolism
abounds. We do not amongst these ruins find portrayals
of Mithras as a youth wearing a Phrygian
cap, and “thrusting his dagger into the neck of
the mystic Bull,” but again and again, in the bas-reliefs
adorning the walls, we do find a colossal
being thrusting his dagger into the body of a
still more “mystic” creature than the Bull of the

<p>Perrot and Chipiez have supposed this constantly
repeated scene to represent imaginary<span class="pagenum" id="Page65">[65]</span>
contests between the reigning monarch and all
possible or impossible monsters, but a very
different impression was produced on the mind of
Ker Porter by these same bas-reliefs; and though
he did not adopt a purely astronomic theory to explain
them, he was firmly convinced that the combat
depicted was not one waged between an ordinary
human being and an ordinary or extraordinary
animal, but that it was a symbolical representation
of the combat constantly carried on by Ormuzd
(Ahura Mazda), and by his representative Mithras,
against the powers of evil and darkness.<a id="FNanchor36" href="#Footnote36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote36" href="#FNanchor36" class="label">[36]</a> “The man who contends with the animals ... is represented
as a person of a singularly dignified mien, clad in long
draperied robes, but with the arms perfectly bare. His hair,
which is full and curled, is bound with a circlet or low diadem;
and his sweeping pointed beard is curled at different heights, in
the style that was worn by majesty alone.... The calmness
of his air, contrasted with the firmness with which he grasps the
animals, and strikes to his aim, gives a certainty to his object, and
a sublimity to his figure, beyond anything that would have been in
the power of more elaborate action or ornament to effect. From
the unchanged appearance of the hero, his unvaried mode of
attack, its success, and the unaltered style of opposition adopted
by every one of the animals in the contest, I can have no doubt
that they all mean different achievements towards one great aim....”—Ker

<p>With the astronomic clue to Persian symbolism<span class="pagenum" id="Page66">[66]</span>
put into our hands by the Roman sculptures, of
which mention has been made, and by a study
of the researches of Lajard, it is not difficult to
recognize in the composite animals represented on
the bas-reliefs allusions not only to the Zodiacal
Bull, traditionally associated with the spring
equinox, but also to three other constellations
which at the same date of the world’s history
(namely, from 4,000 to 2,000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>) marked more
or less accurately the remaining colures, <i>i.e.</i> the
Lion, the Scorpion, and the Eagle.</p>

<p>The constellations of the Lion and the Scorpion,
there can be no doubt, were appropriate star
marks for the summer and autumn seasons, when
the spring equinoctial point was in the Bull,<a id="FNanchor37" href="#Footnote37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> but
as regards the Eagle it must be admitted that
though it adjoins the Zodiacal Aquarius (the constellation
in which the winter solstitial point was
then situated), yet its principal stars lie considerably
to the north and west of that constellation.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote37" href="#FNanchor37" class="label">[37]</a> The solstitial and equinoctial colures were situated, speaking
in round numbers, for 2,000 years in the constellations Taurus,
Leo, Scorpio, and Aquarius.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>A reason for the substitution of the Eagle
(Aquila) for the Zodiacal Water-man or Water-jar<span class="pagenum" id="Page67">[67]</span>
(Aquarius or Amphora) may, however, be found
in the fact of the very great brilliancy of the
star Altair in the Eagle. It is a star of the first
magnitude. In the Water-man there is no star
above the third. The Persians, we are told, had
a tradition that four brilliant stars marked the four
cardinal points (<i>i.e.</i> the colures). In Taurus, Leo,
and Scorpio we find stars of the first magnitude:
there was therefore no temptation for Mithraic
calendar makers and mythologists to seek for an
extra-Zodiacal star to mark and represent the
spring, summer, or autumn seasons; but for the
winter solstice the only stars of the first magnitude
within at all suitable distance were Aquila, to the
north-west, or Fomalhaut to the south of Aquarius.
For a nation dwelling as far to the north as the
Medians are supposed to have done, Fomalhaut
(when the winter solstice was in Aquarius very
far to the south of the equator) would have been
rarely visible. The choice by a Median astronomer
and symbolic artist in search of a very brilliant star
mark for the solstice would therefore have been restricted
to the constellation of the Eagle, containing
the conspicuous Altair, a star of the first magnitude.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page68">[68]</span></p>

<p>The very constant association, not only in
Persian and Median, but also in the mythologic
art of other nations, of the Lion and the Eagle,
seems to confirm the view here put forward, <i>i.e.</i>
that the constellations of Leo and Aquila rather
than of Leo and Aquarius were sometimes chosen
to symbolise the summer and winter solstices.</p>

<p>The Griffin, a fabulous animal sacred to the
sun, composed of a <i>Lion</i> and an <i>Eagle</i>, is a
well-known figure in ancient classic art.</p>

<p>In Babylonian and Assyrian sculptured and
glyptic art Merodach is often represented as in
conflict with a Griffin. Merodach has been claimed
by Jensen and other writers as a personification
of the sun of the spring equinox. The for ever
recurring triumph of spring over winter is probably
figured in Merodach’s triumph over the Griffin.</p>

<p>The association of Eagle and Lion is to be
noticed in the arms of the city of Lagash; they
were “a double-headed Eagle standing on a Lion
passant or on two demi-lions placed back to back.”<a id="FNanchor38" href="#Footnote38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
In Lagash, as was pointed out in a former paper, the
new year’s festival appears to have been held at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page69">[69]</span>
winter solstice: such a supposition would furnish an
astronomical interpretation for the arms of Lagash.<a id="FNanchor39" href="#Footnote39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p><a id="Footnote39" href="#FNanchor39" class="label">[39]</a> In this connexion the following passage from Sayce’s
<i>Hibbert Lectures</i>, p. 261, is interesting:—</p>

<p>A text copied for Assur-banipal, from a tablet originally written
at Babylon, contains part of a hymn which had to be recited “in
the presence of Bel-Merodach ... in the beginning of Nisan,”—</p>

<div class="verse indent00">“... O Zamama,</div>

<div class="verse indent0">Bahu, the Queen of Kis, has not cried to thee.”</div>
</div><!--stanza-->
</div><!--poetry-->
</div><!--container-->

<p>He adds in a note that Zamama was the Sun-god of Kis, and
was consequently identified with Adar by the mythologists. On
a contract-stone he is symbolized by an eagle, which is said to be
“the image of the southern sun of Kis.”</p>

<p>It was claimed in a former paper (Feb. 1896) that “<i>the Southern
sun</i>” was “<i>the sun of the winter solstice</i>,” and that Gula (= Bahu)
was the name of the constellation, or of some stars in the constellation
Aquarius (V. <a href="#Page50">p. 50</a>). In these lines Bahu, as I have supposed,
Aquarius, and Zamama, symbolised by the <i>Eagle, the
image of the Southern sun or winter solstice</i>, are closely associated.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>Mythological references to the Eagle alone are
also to be met with which point to the Celestial
Eagle (Aquila) marking the winter solstice in lieu
of the constellation Aquarius, as for instance the
Babylonian legend of the ambitious storm-bird, Zu,<a id="FNanchor40" href="#Footnote40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
who stole the tablets of destiny, and thus sought to
vie in power with “the great gods.” Here we may
find allusions to the substitution (deemed by some,<span class="pagenum" id="Page70">[70]</span>
no doubt, unauthorized) of an extra-Zodiacal for a
Zodiacal constellation.</p>

<p>Again, in Grecian mythology the Eagle is sent
by Zeus to carry Ganymede up to heaven, and
in Grecian astronomy Ganymede is placed in the
constellation Aquarius. It does not therefore seem
unreasonable to suppose that the Eagle associated
in the Persepolitan bas-reliefs with the Lion, the
Bull, and the Scorpion (as at <a href="#PlateIV">Plate IV.</a>), is the constellational
Eagle, symbolizing the winter solstice,
and that the compound animal is emblematic of
the four seasons of the year, and also, it may be,
of the four quarters of the world.</p>

<p>If to the composite monster of the bas-reliefs
we ascribe an astronomic motive, we shall be ready
to grant the same to other Tauric symbolisms
prominent in the Persepolitan ruins.</p>

<p>With full conviction we shall recognize in the
demi-bulls which crowned the columns in Persepolis
and Susa representations of the demi-bull of the
Zodiac. The resemblance is so striking that words
are scarcely required to point it out when once
the outlines of the two figures have been compared
(<a href="#PlateV">Plate V.</a>). In the spirited description of these<span class="pagenum" id="Page71">[71]</span>
capitals, quoted here from Perrot and Chipiez,<a id="FNanchor41" href="#Footnote41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> are

<p>For the exquisite columns crowned by these
Tauric capitals the same writers have claimed a
distinctively Median origin. This claim they sustain
at great length, and with much architectural
learning. They show that in their proportions, and
in every detail of their ornamentation, the Persepolitan
differed from the Ninevite, Grecian, or
Egyptian column. They also point out that nowhere
except at Persepolis and at Susa is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page73">[73]</span>
demi-bull of the capital to be met with; and
yet they express the opinion that this feature,
so far as is known proper to Persia, was mainly
derived from, or helped at least by, the models
of Assyria.</p>

<p>Very close resemblances can indeed be traced in
Medo-Persian to Assyrian art, and as the Medo-Persian
buildings, whose ruins are at Persepolis and
Susa, were erected certainly at a later date than the
palaces of the Assyrian kings discovered on the
site of Nineveh, it is natural to attribute, as Perrot
and Chipiez, and nearly all writers on the subject
attribute, such resemblances to imitations of
Assyrian art and symbolism on the part of the
Medo-Persians.</p>

<p>There are, however, some considerations which
make it difficult to adopt this view. In the first
place, the symbolism supposed to have been copied
by the Medo-Persians was religious symbolism, and
the religion of the Aryan Medo-Persians was very
different from that of the Semitic Assyrians.</p>

<p>The Achæmenid kings who built their palaces
at Persepolis claimed constantly that they were
worshippers of the one great Lord Ahura Mazda,<span class="pagenum" id="Page74">[74]</span>
of whom Mithras was the friend and representative.
That these kings should have adopted from the
polytheistic Assyrians not only the Tauric symbolism
above described, but also, as it is suggested,
the emblem of their one great Lord
Ahura Mazda from that of Assur (see <a href="#PlateVI">Plate VI.</a>
<a href="#VI1">figs. 1</a>, <a href="#VI2">2</a>, <a href="#VI3">3</a>), would in itself be strange, but that
they should have done so when Assur and all his
followers had been utterly vanquished by the
victorious worshippers of Ahura Mazda, seems still
more improbable.</p>

<p>From the state in which the ruins of Nineveh
were when discovered by Layard it is easy to
see that, from the very day of the sacking of
the city, it had for the most part been left
just as it fell. It may have been rifled of its
material wealth, but its literary and artistic
treasures were left uncared for and undesired. A
few hundred years later the very site of Nineveh
was unknown.</p>

<p>The great city would not have been treated with
such neglect had the Medo-Persian artists turned
to it for inspiration and for themes of symbolic
art with which to decorate the palaces of Persepolis.</p>

<p>The resemblance, however, between Medo-Persian
and Ninevite art is in many instances so
striking that some way of accounting for it must
be sought, and those who are dissatisfied with one
explanation will naturally look about to find some
alternative suggestion.</p>

<p>The alternative suggestion I would now propose
is that <i>the progenitors of the Assyrians at an
early period of the world’s history borrowed Tauric
and other religious symbolisms from the ancestors of
the Medes</i>.</p>

<p>In support of this theory the following considerations
are put forward:</p>

<p>Tauric symbolism, if it is at all astronomic,
points us back to a very remote date for its first
institution, to a date considerably earlier than that
at which the existence of the Assyrian people as
an independent nation is generally put. The symbolism
already discussed must, at the latest, have
been originated about 2,000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span> Of the Assyrians
as a nation we have no monumental proof earlier
than 1,700 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span></p>

<p>But further, in the symbol of Ahura and Assur,
I believe an astronomic reference may be traced<span class="pagenum" id="Page76">[76]</span>
to the position of the colures amongst the constellations,
a reference which points us back not
merely to a date between 4,000 and 2,000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>, but
rather, and with curious precision, to the furthest
limit of the time mentioned, namely to 4,000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span></p>

<p>To penetrate into the meaning of this symbol
of Ahura we must study both the Median and
Assyrian representations of the figure presiding
over the winged disc, and we may also seek for
further light to be thrown upon it by other references
in Assyrian art to the god Assur.</p>

<p>Ahura presiding over the winged circle holds
in his hand a ring or crown; Assur in some examples
is similarly furnished; but more often he
appears armed with bow and arrows. In this figure,
variously equipped, I believe that the heavenly
Archer, the Zodiacal Sagittarius (<a href="#PlateVI">Plate VI.</a> <a href="#VI4">fig. 4</a>),
is to be recognized—Sagittarius, the constellation in
which the autumnal equinoctial point was situated,
speaking in round numbers, from 6,000 to 4,000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span></p>

<p>The fact that a crown or wreath or ring often
replaces the bow and arrows in the hand of Ahura
and of Assur might at first sight make us doubtful
as to the connexion of the figure with the constellation<span class="pagenum" id="Page77">[77]</span>
Sagittarius, but a glance at the celestial globe
will rather make this fact tell in favour of the astronomical
suggestion here made: for there we find
close to the hand of the Archer the ancient Ptolemaic
constellation Corona Australis (the Southern
Crown), actually incorporated with the Zodiacal constellation
Sagittarius.</p>

<p>Not only do Assur’s bow and crown remind
us of Sagittarius, but his horned tiara, resembling
so closely that worn by the man-headed Assyrian
bulls, inclines us to look for some astronomic and
Tauric allusion in this Assyrian and Median
symbol.</p>

<p>True it is that, speaking generally, Gemini
and not Taurus is the constellation of the Zodiac
opposed to Sagittarius, but owing to the irregularity
in the shape and size of the portions assigned
in the ecliptic to the Zodiacal constellations, the
extreme western degrees of Sagittarius are opposed
to the extreme eastern degrees of Taurus. Therefore
about 4,000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span> the equinoctial colure passed
through the constellations of the Archer and the Bull.</p>

<div class="container w30emmax">

<img src="images/illo106.jpg" alt="Assyrian Standard">

</div><!--container-->

<p>In the Assyrian Standard (depicted in
Layard’s <i>Monuments of Nineveh</i>, Plate XXII.)
we see the figure of an Archer above that
of a galloping Bull, and in another Assyrian
Standard, that of Sargon II., we find not only
the Archer and the Bull, the two constellations
which 4,000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span> marked the <i>equinoctial</i> colure,
but we may also clearly trace a reference to the
two constellations which at the same date marked
the <i>solstitial</i> colure, namely, those of the Lion
and the Water-man (<a href="#PlateVII">Plate VII.</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page79">[79]</span></p>

<p>Here the <i>Archer</i> dominates over a circle in
which symmetrically duplicated <i>Bulls</i> appear, and
duplicated <i>Lions’</i> heads emerge out of what appears
to be a hollow vessel resembling a <i>water jar</i>; the
wavy lines that traverse the disc suggest streams
that unitedly pour their waters into this jar. Below
the jar again are to be seen halved and doubled
heads, partly Lion and partly Bull.</p>

<p>This Standard of Assur may (like the Persepolitan
monster earlier described) be considered
as an astronomic monogram representing the four
constellations which marked the four seasons of
the year, and the four quarters of the earth.</p>

<p>The monogram of the Standard refers us back,
however, to an earlier date for its origin than
does the monogram of the composite animal in
the Persepolitan bas-relief, for in the Standard the
Archer is opposed to the Bull, in the bas-relief<span class="pagenum" id="Page80">[80]</span>
the Scorpion takes the place of the Archer, and
the Eagle takes the place of the Water-man.</p>

<p>The precession of the equinoxes advances from
east to west amongst the stars. Therefore the
Scorpion marked the colure at a later date than
did the Archer. The Eagle, as has already been
pointed out, is considerably to the west of Aquarius,
and could scarcely have been chosen as a substitute
for that constellation when the colure was
in its extreme eastern degrees.</p>

<p>At <a href="#PlateVIII">Plate VIII.</a> is given the position of the
colures at 4,000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>; not much earlier or much
later than this date can we place the <i>origin</i> of the
symbolism in the Standard shown at <a href="#PlateVII">Plate VII.</a>
Earlier <i>not</i> Leo and Aquarius, but Virgo and
Pisces, would have marked the solstitial colure.
Later <i>not</i> Sagittarius, but Scorpio, would have in
opposition to Taurus marked the equinoctial colure.</p>

<p>At this date, 4,000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>, suggested with such
curious accuracy by this Assyrian Standard, we
have absolutely no trace of the existence of the
<i>Semitic nation of the Assyrians</i> in Northern Mesopotamia.
In Babylonia two hundred years later
the Semitic Sargon I. ruled at Accad. In the
astrological work drawn up, if not for Sargon yet,
as we may judge from internal evidence, for some
king of Accad, no mention is made of the Assyrian
nation.</p>

<p>The Phœnicians, the Hittites, the Kings of
Gutium, and the “Umman Manda” are then the
dreaded foes of Accad. Of the Manda we read as
follows: “The Umman Manda comes and governs
the land. The mercy seats of the great gods are
taken away. Bel goes to Elam.”</p>

<p>Professor Sayce is opposed to the view that
the Manda are necessarily identical with the
Medes; but he admits that Herodotus, following
the authority of Medo-Persian writers, claimed as
Median the victories of the Manda.<a id="FNanchor42" href="#Footnote42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>If now on the authority of Herodotus and the
Medo-Persian writers we assume, at least as a
possibility, that these Manda were Medes, we
should expect to find them worshippers of Ahura
Mazda. Ahura, it is on all hands admitted, is the
Iranian form of the Vedic Asura, just as Mithras
is the Iranian form of the Vedic Mitra. At whatever
date the separation between Iranian and Vedic<span class="pagenum" id="Page82">[82]</span>
Aryans took place, the worship of Ahura (still
probably under the form Asura) must have existed
amongst the Iranians; indeed, many have supposed
that the monotheistic reform which placed
one great Ahura or Asura above all other Asuras,
and above the Devas, occasioned the separation
of these two great Aryan races.</p>

<p>It is for the Lord Ahura, called, as here
supposed, Asura, in early times, by the Aryan
Manda, that I would claim the astronomical
symbol of the Archer presiding over the circle of
the ecliptic, or, in other words, over the circle of
the year, and of a year beginning at the spring
equinox—a year, as has already been pointed out,
distinctively Median.</p>

<p>According then to this supposition, a powerful
Median race was established in the vicinity of
Babylonia early in the fourth millennium <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>—a
race who worshipped one great Lord, first under
the name of Asura, afterwards under that of
Ahura.</p>

<p>It is for these Aryan Manda or Medes that I
would claim, at the date of 4,000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>, the original
conception of the astronomic monogram in which<span class="pagenum" id="Page83">[83]</span>
so plainly may be read an allusion to the four constellations
of the Zodiac, which at that date marked
the four seasons and the four cardinal points, <i>i.e.</i>
Sagittarius and Taurus, Aquarius and Leo. This
monogram was used as a Standard thousands of
years later by the Semitic Assyrians.</p>

<p>To the Manda or Medes, also, I would, as
has been suggested, attribute the first imagining
of the astronomic emblem common to Ahura and
Assur—that of the divine Being presiding over
the circle of the ecliptic.</p>

<p>Berosus mentions a Median dynasty as having
reigned in Babylon for one or two hundred years.
Let us now suppose that the Manda for more
than a thousand years held power in <i>Northern</i>
Mesopotamia, but that at last the tide of conquest
turned, and after many struggles with the Semites
in the south the Aryans were finally driven from
the land now known as Assyria, and a Semite
race firmly settled in the regions from whence in
Sargon’s time the Umman Manda had threatened
the inhabitants of the Kingdom of Accad. That
this was the case about 2,200 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span> may perhaps be
gathered from the monuments of Ḫammurabi, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page84">[84]</span>
Semitic king of Babylon, for he refers in his letters
to his troops in <i>Assyria</i>, and in a lately discovered
inscription of this king he speaks of restoring to
the city of <i>Assur</i> its propitious genie, and of
honouring Istar in the city of Nineveh.</p>

<p>To account for the existence of the Assyrian
nation, their close resemblance in language and
race to the ruling Semitic class in Babylon, and
yet to explain the great difference in the religion
of these two peoples, has always been a difficulty.</p>

<p>The Assyrians worshipped, and worshipped with
enthusiasm, all the Babylonian gods; but high
above the whole Babylonian Pantheon they placed
as their supreme and great Lord Assur—Assur
whose very name is not to be met with in Babylonian
mythology. This difficulty I would explain
in the following manner.</p>

<p>When the Medes had, by Ḫammurabi or his
successors, been driven out of Northern Mesopotamia,
they were replaced by Semitic settlers who
(like the settlers sent into Samaria more than a
thousand years later by a king of Assyria) adopted,
to a certain extent, the religion of the nation whom
they had dispossessed. In 2 Kings xvii. we read<span class="pagenum" id="Page85">[85]</span>
that in this parallel instance “the king of Assyria
brought men from Babylon, and from Cuthah, and
from Ava, and from Hamath, and from Sepharvaim,
and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of
the children of Israel: and they possessed Samaria,
and dwelt in the cities thereof.” Later in the same
chapter we read that in order to appease, as they
believed, the wrath of the “God of the land,” these
idolatrous settlers, retaining in full the worship of
all their own gods, added to it a worship of the
Lord of the dispossessed Israelites.</p>

<p>I would suppose then that the polytheistic
Semites, who in Ḫammurabi’s time were settled in
Northern Mesopotamia, had acted in a similar
manner. Coming into a region where for nearly
2,000 years the monotheistic Medes or Manda had
been established, they, to avert the wrath of the
<i>god of the land</i>, adopted to a certain extent his
worship. In fact, like the Samaritans, “they feared
the Lord [Asura], and served their own gods.”</p>

<p>This explanation of the difference in religion
between the Babylonians and the Assyrians seems
to yield also an explanation of the resemblances
between the Assyrian and Median religions, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page86">[86]</span>
rather of the resemblances between the religious
art of the two peoples; and thus we return to the
problem proposed for discussion earlier in this
Paper, namely, the inadequacy of the generally
held opinion which accounts for the resemblances
in Persepolitan and Ninevite symbolic art by
supposing that the Medes borrowed from the
Assyrians.</p>

<p>In support of the alternative suggestion put
forward at <a href="#Page75">p. 75</a>, that <i>the progenitors of the
Assyrians at an early period of the worlds history
borrowed Tauric and other religious symbolisms
from the ancestors of the Medes</i>, I would claim that
the Assyrians borrowed not only religious symbolisms,
but even the very name of their god Assur
from the Medes. For I look upon Assur as a
“loan word” adopted from the Aryan Asura.</p>

<p>To the Medes or Manda, who were, as has
been argued, in power in Northern Mesopotamia
about 4,000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>, I have attributed the origin of
the astronomic Assyrian and Ahurian emblem.
To them, on the same grounds, I attribute
the first imagining of the astronomic Assyrian
Standard, and the devising of the man-headed and<span class="pagenum" id="Page87">[87]</span>
winged monsters so well known as “Assyrian
Bulls”; and to them I would, with full conviction,
leave the honour of having invented, and not borrowed,
the idea of the magnificent Tauric capitals
that crowned the columns of Persepolis and Susa.</p>

<p>To all these conclusions I have been led by
a consideration of the distinctively equinoctial
character of the Median calendar, taken in connexion
with the importance given in Median art
to the constellation Taurus.</p>

ASTRONOMY IN THE RIG VEDA</h3>

<p class="reprint">[Reprinted from the Report of the <i>Actes</i> of the Twelfth Oriental
Congress held at Rome]</p>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>Not much more than a hundred years ago the
Sanscrit language began to yield to the study of
Europeans some of its literary treasures. Almost
on the moment, a controversy arose as to the
antiquity of the science of astronomy in India;
for scholars were amazed to find in this already
long dead language many learned astronomical
treatises, besides complete instructions for calculating,
year by year, the Hindu calendar, as also
for calculating horoscopes.</p>

<p>Some then proclaimed the wonderful facts revealed,
and extolled the antiquity and accuracy
of this Indian science, while others, noticing the
many points of resemblance between European
and Indian methods, supposed, and warmly advocated<span class="pagenum" id="Page89">[89]</span>
the opinion, that much of the astronomy
contained in Sanscrit works had been borrowed
from the Greeks.</p>

<p>Sir William Jones was amongst the first to
enter the lists against this Grecian theory; and
he thus throws down his glove in defence of the
antiquity and originality of the science of astronomy
in India.</p>

<p>“I engage to support an opinion (which the
learned and industrious M. Montucla seems to
treat with extreme contempt) that the <i>Indian</i>
division of the Zodiack was not borrowed from
the <i>Greeks</i> or <i>Arabs</i>, but, having been known in
this country (India) for time immemorial, and being
the same in part with that used by other nations
of the old <i>Hindu</i> race, was probably invented by
the first progenitors of that race before their dispersion.”<a id="FNanchor43" href="#Footnote43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p><a id="Footnote43" href="#FNanchor43" class="label">[43]</a>
<i>On the Antiquity of the Indian Zodiack. Complete Works</i>,
vol. i. p. 333.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>Since Sir William Jones wrote this challenge,
and supported it with whatever linguistic and
scientific resources were at his command, volumes
of heated controversy by many authors have been
devoted to the same subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page90">[90]</span></p>

<p>Just at present, however, an almost indifferent
calmness has taken the place of the excited interest
formerly manifested. The majority of scholars,
both European and Indian, appear to have accepted,
as an axiom, the opinion that much of
Indian astronomy, and certainly the Indian acquaintance
with the twelve-fold division of the
Zodiac, is to be attributed to Grecian influence.</p>

<p>A minority of writers still hold the view advocated
by Sir William Jones about a hundred years
ago, and thus reiterated by Burgess (the translator
of the Indian standard astronomical work the
<i>Sûrya-Siddhânta</i>) in 1860. “The use of this
(twelve-fold) division, and the present names of
the signs, can be proved to have existed in India
at as early a period as in any other country.”<a id="FNanchor44" href="#Footnote44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote44" href="#FNanchor44" class="label">[44]</a>
<i>Journal of the American Oriental Society</i>, vol. vi. p. 477.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>The minority who hold this view are so few
at present that, as has been said, the majority rest
in their opposed opinion in all the calmness of
conviction.</p>

<p>I will now as briefly as possible state the
chief arguments put forward, for and against, this
conviction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page91">[91]</span></p>

<p>I. In favour of the comparatively late introduction
into India of the twelve-fold division of
the Zodiac, it is contended that the divisions of
the Indian Solar Zodiac so closely resemble those
of the Grecian (the Zodiac which we to this day
depict on celestial globes), that it is not possible
to believe that two nations or two sets of astronomers
could independently of each other have
imagined the same fanciful and apparently inconsequent
series.</p>

<p>History does not tell of communication between
Greece and India, sufficient to account for this
similarity of astronomical method, till after the
date of Alexander’s conquest—about 300 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span> The
Greeks could not at that late date have first become
acquainted with the figures of the Zodiac, for in
Grecian literature of a much earlier age the figures
of the Zodiac and other constellations are alluded
to as already perfectly well known. As the Greeks
therefore could not have learnt all their astronomic
lore from the Indians, the Indians must have learnt
theirs from the Greeks at some date later than
Alexander’s Eastern conquests.</p>

<p>A corroboration of this opinion is drawn from<span class="pagenum" id="Page92">[92]</span>
the consideration that, in the most ancient Sanscrit
work in existence—the purely Indian Rig Veda,
containing no Grecian taint—the twelve-fold
divisions of the Zodiac appear to be unknown.
This opinion as to the Rashis or constellations
of the Solar Zodiac is so generally adopted, that
the age of any Sanscrit work in which mention
of these Rashis occurs is at once—no matter what
its claims to antiquity may be—set down as not
earlier than the comparatively modern date of
300 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span></p>

<p>II. As regards the Indian Lunar Zodiac. The
Indians make use at present for calendrical purposes,
not only of the twelve-fold Solar Zodiac,
they have also a series of 27 Nakshatras, or Lunar
mansions (this is for convenience sake designated
by European writers as the Lunar Zodiac). It is
admitted on all hands that the Nakshatra series
was not derived from Grecian sources. But it is
contended that the fixation of the initial point of
this Lunar Zodiac (a point at the end of Revatī
and the beginning of Aswinī, 10 degrees west of
the first point of our constellation Aries) was due
to an astronomical reform of the Hindu calendar,<span class="pagenum" id="Page93">[93]</span>
probably carried out under Grecian auspices at a
date not much earlier than 600 <span class="smcapall">A.D.</span> A very clear
statement of this opinion is thus given by Whitney
(the editor of Burgess’ translation of the <i>Sûrya
Siddhânta</i>):—</p>

<div class="quote">

<p>“The initial point of the fixed Hindu sphere
from which longitudes are reckoned, and at which
the planetary motions are held by all schools of
Hindu astronomy to have commenced at the
creation, is the end of the asterism Revatî, or the
beginning of Açvinî. Its situation is most nearly
marked by that of the principal star of Revatî ...
that star is by all authorities identified with
ζ Piscium, of which the longitude at present, as
reckoned by us, from the Vernal Equinox, is
17° 54´. Making due allowance for the precession
(of the equinoxes), we find that it coincided in
position with the vernal equinox, not far from the
middle of the sixth century, or about <span class="smcapall">A.D.</span> 570.
<i>As such coincidence was the occasion of the point
being fixed upon as the beginning of the sphere</i>, the
time of its occurrence marks approximately the
era of the fixation of the sphere, and of the commencement
of the history of modern Hindu
astronomy.”<a id="FNanchor45" href="#Footnote45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

</div><!--quote-->

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote45" href="#FNanchor45" class="label">[45]</a> <i>Journal of the American Oriental Society</i>, vol. vi. p. 158.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page94">[94]</span></p>

<p>In further corroboration of this view—deduced
from the astronomical supposition (to which I
have drawn attention by italics) put forward in
this extract—ancient Sanscrit literature is appealed
to. Hymns and lists referring to the Nakshatras
are to be met with in the Yajur and Atharva
Vedas, in which Krittikā, now the third Nakshatra,
holds the first place.</p>

<p>The Nakshatra Krittikā contains the group of
stars known to us as the Pleiades. The most
brilliant stars in the Nakshatra Aswinī are the
two stars in the head of the constellation Aries
(the Ram), known to astronomers as α and β
Arietis.</p>

<p>The vernal equinoctial point coincided about
2,000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span> with the constellation Krittikā. It is
considered to be most probable that on account
of this coincidence, at the early date when the
hymns and list in question were composed,
Krittikā was chosen as the leader of the Nakshatra
series, and hence a similar reason for the later
choice of Aswinī as leader relegates it to a date
not much earlier than 570 <span class="smcapall">A.D.</span></p>

<p>These very briefly, as far as I have been able<span class="pagenum" id="Page95">[95]</span>
to gather them, are the chief arguments in favour
of—</p>

<p>(1) The Grecian introduction of the twelve-fold
Zodiac into India about 300 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span></p>

<p>(2) The date of 570 <span class="smcapall">A.D.</span> for the fixation of
the initial point of the Indian Zodiacs, and for
the commencement of the history of Indian
astronomy.</p>

<p>These propositions are based on cogent reasonings,
and are maintained by very high authorities.
The opponents of the modern theory have brought
and bring forward the following considerations:—</p>

<div class="quote">

<p>“The <i>Bráhmans</i> were always too proud to
borrow their science from the <i>Greeks</i>, <i>Arabs</i>,
<i>Moguls</i>, or any nation of <i>Mléchch’has</i>, as they call
those who are ignorant of the <i>Védas</i>, and have not
studied the language of the Gods; they have often
quoted to me (Sir William Jones) the fragment of
an old verse, which they now use proverbially
(<i>na níchò yavanátparah</i>), or, ‘<i>no base creature can be
lower than a Yavan</i>,’ by which name they formerly
meant an <i>Ionian</i> or <i>Greek</i>, and now mean a
<i>Mogul</i>.”<a id="FNanchor46" href="#Footnote46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

</div><!--quote-->

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote46" href="#FNanchor46" class="label">[46]</a> Sir William Jones, <i>The Antiquity of the Indian Zodiack,
Complete Works</i>, vol. i. p. 345.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page96">[96]</span></p>

<p>Again the same writer points out that the
resemblance between the Indian and the Greek
Zodiac is—</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="noindent">“not more extraordinary than that, which has
often been observed between our <i>Gothick</i> days of
the week and those of the <i>Hindus</i>, which are
dedicated to the same luminaries, and (what is yet
more singular) revolve in the same order: <i>Ravi</i>,
the Sun; <i>Sóma</i>, the Moon; <i>Mangala</i>, Tuisco;
<i>Budha</i>, Woden; <i>Vrihaspati</i>, Thor; <i>Sucra</i>, Freya;
<i>Sani</i>, Sater; yet no man ever imagined that the
<i>Indians</i> borrowed so remarkable an arrangement
from the <i>Goths</i> or <i>Germans</i>.”</p>

</div><!--quote-->

<p>These considerations put forward by Sir
William Jones are further emphasized by the
reflection that not only does the Grecian theory
entail the improbability of the proud and jealous
Brahmins adopting into their science and their
mythology the teachings of foreigners; but that
it also entails the greater improbability of the two
rival Hindu sects, Brahmins and Buddhists, having
at the same date and with equal enthusiasm
adopted into their science and religious symbolism
and calendars the same innovations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page97">[97]</span></p>

<p>Again the opinion of the Greek writers at the
beginning of our era may be quoted as showing
the high estimation in which, at that time of the
world, Indian astronomy was held: as for instance
in the life of Apollonius of Tyana (written about
210 <span class="smcapall">A.D.</span> by Philostratus), the wisdom and learning
of Apollonius are set high above those of all his
contemporaries; but from the sages of India he
is represented as learning many things, especially
matters of astronomy.<a id="FNanchor47" href="#Footnote47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p><a id="Footnote47" href="#FNanchor47" class="label">[47]</a> <i>Apollonius of Tyana</i>, Book iii. chapter 13.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>This high opinion held by Greeks in regard
to Indian astronomy may be contrasted with the
very moderate praise bestowed on the Grecian
science by Garga, a Hindu writer of, it is supposed,
the first century <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span> He says:—</p>

<div class="quote">

<p>“The Yavanas (Greeks) are Mlechchas (non-Hindus,
or barbarians), but amongst them this
science (astronomy) is well established. Therefore
they are honoured as Rishis (saints); how much
more then an astronomer who is a Brahman?”<a id="FNanchor48" href="#Footnote48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>Somewhat to the same effect speaks a Hindu
author of a later date, Varāhamihira, who wrote<span class="pagenum" id="Page98">[98]</span>
an astronomical dissertation treating of five different
works known to him on the science of astronomy.
He says:—</p>

<div class="quote">

<p>“There are the following Siddhântas: The
Pauliśa, the Romaka, the Vâsisṭha, the Saura, and
the Paitámaha. Out of these five, the first two
(the Pauliśa and Romaka, which appear to have
been European treatises) have been explained by
Lâṱadeva. The Siddhânta made by Pauliśa is
accurate, near to it stands the Siddhánta proclaimed
by Romaka; more accurate is the Sávitra
(Saura)<a id="FNanchor49" href="#Footnote49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> (<i>Sūrya Siddhānta</i>, the <i>Hindu</i> standard
work); the two remaining ones are far from the
truth.”<a id="FNanchor50" href="#Footnote50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

</div><!--quote-->

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote49" href="#FNanchor49" class="label">[49]</a> This opinion of Varāha has been confirmed by modern
European scholars. Burgess (from whose translations of the
<i>Sūrya Siddhānta</i> we have already quoted) remarks, “in regard to
... the amount of the annual precession of the equinoxes, the
relative size of the sun and moon as compared with the earth,
the greatest equation of the centre of the sun, the Hindus are
more nearly correct than the Greeks.” (<i>Journal of the American
Oriental Society</i>, vol. vi. p. 480.)</p>

<p><a id="Footnote50" href="#FNanchor50" class="label">[50]</a> <i>The
Pañchasiddhântikâ.</i> Edited by G. Thibaut, ch. i. § 3.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>This moderate, and, as it reads, judicial opinion
of Varāhamihira, touching the superiority of the
native <i>Sūrya Siddhānta</i> over the Pauliśa and
Romaka Siddhāntas, may be appealed to as not<span class="pagenum" id="Page99">[99]</span>
conveying the impression that when Varāha
wrote his co-religionists and scientists were
accepting, wholesale and with avidity, Grecian
astronomic methods in place of their own already
well-established native science. It is true that
in Varāha’s work many words evidently of Grecian
origin are to be met with; and some scholars
have claimed that these “Greek terms occurring
in Varāhamihira’s writings are conclusive proofs
of the Greek origin of Hindu astronomy.” That
such terms should occur in a work professedly
a <i>resumé</i> of five astronomic treatises—some of
them Indian, and some European—can scarcely be
considered as conclusive proof that in the writer’s
time no purely Indian astronomic science existed.
Varāha’s writings suggest an author interested
in comparing the resemblances and the differences
to be met with in home and foreign methods, rather
than one introducing for the first time important
astronomic truths to the notice of his readers.</p>

<p>It may be further urged that the claims to antiquity
in Sanscrit astronomical works are so well
known, that those who adopt the Grecian theory
must necessarily throw discredit in a very wholesale<span class="pagenum" id="Page100">[100]</span>
manner on all their authors. Bentley’s furious
diatribes may be quoted as an extreme example of
the way in which the evidence of such Sanscrit
claimants to antiquity is sometimes dealt with; and
it may be pointed out that such violent denunciation
cannot be looked on as convincing argument.</p>

<div class="quote">

<p>“The fact is,” writes Bentley, “that literary
forgeries are now so common in India, that we can
hardly know what book is genuine, and what not:
perhaps there is not one book in a hundred, nay,
probably in a thousand, that is not a forgery, in
some point of view or other; and even those that
are allowed or supposed to be genuine, are found
to be full of interpolations, to answer some particular
ends: nor need we be surprised at all this, when
we consider the facilities they have for forgeries,
as well as their own general inclination and interest
in following that profession; for to give the appearance
of antiquity to their books and authors
increases their value, at least in the eyes of some.
Their universal propensity to forgeries, ever since
the introduction of the modern system of astronomy
and immense periods of years, in <span class="smcapall">A.D.</span> 538, are but
too well known to require any further elucidation
than those already given. They are under no
restraint of laws, human or divine, and subject to<span class="pagenum" id="Page101">[101]</span>
no punishment, even if detected in the most flagrant
literary impositions.”<a id="FNanchor51" href="#Footnote51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>It is unnecessary now to further pursue the pros
and cons of what has hitherto been said and written
on the vexed questions as to the originality and
antiquity of astronomy in India, and especially as
to the Indian acquaintance with the twelve-fold
divisions of the Zodiac, and the date of the fixation
of the initial point in their Zodiac. We have seen
that by the majority the Grecian and modern theory
is the favoured one.</p>

<p>Within the last quarter of a century, however,
an unexpected reinforcement has come into the
field, in aid of the disheartened and nearly silenced
minority, who still believe in a great antiquity for
the science of astronomy in India.</p>

<p>The researches of archæologists in Western Asia
have of late brought to our knowledge vast hoards
of information concerning the ancient inhabitants
of Babylonia and Assyria, and the surrounding
highlands and plains; amongst other matters, concerning
the science of astronomy possessed by
these peoples.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page102">[102]</span></p>

<p>In 1874, a Paper entitled <i>The Astronomy and
Astrology of the Babylonians</i> was read by Professor
Sayce before the “Society of Biblical Archæology,”
and since that date other Papers, by various authors,
dealing with the subject have appeared in the same
Society’s <i>Proceedings</i>. Also in the <i>Zeitschrift
für Assyriologie</i>, articles have been contributed
by such writers as Epping and Strassmaier, Oppert,
Mayer, Mahler, Jensen, Lehmann, and others, in
which the calendars and astronomical methods in
use in Mesopotamia are discussed.</p>

<p>Epping and Strassmaier’s <i>Astronomisches aus
Babylon</i> and Jensen’s <i>Die Kosmologie der
Babylonier</i>, are important volumes devoted to
these same matters.</p>

<p>Whatever else concerning the subject of all
these writings remains uncertain and open to discussion,
some facts are clearly established. We
now know that the inhabitants of Babylonia in a
remote age (certainly as early as the fourth
millenium <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>) were acquainted with the twelve
divisions of the Zodiac, and that these divisions
were imagined under figures closely resembling in
almost every instance those now depicted on our<span class="pagenum" id="Page103">[103]</span>
celestial globes. The calendar used by the Accadians,
and later by the Semitic Babylonians and
Assyrians, was indeed based on the observance of
the Zodiacal constellations and of the journeyings
through them of the sun and moon. The varying
positions of the planets, Mercury, Venus, Mars,
Jupiter, and Saturn are also noted by references
to the Zodiacal asterisms: and not only Zodiacal,
but several of the extra-Zodiacal ancient constellations
are represented on the monuments.</p>

<p>All this information gained from the cuneiform
tablets concerning the science of astronomy in
Western Asia must undoubtedly affect the judgment
of enquirers into the history of the same
science in India.</p>

<p>Now that it is clearly proved that 3,000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span> and
earlier the twelve-fold fanciful signs of the Solar
Zodiac were known to the inhabitants of Babylonia,
it cannot any longer be asserted dogmatically
that the inhabitants of India must have waited
till 300 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span> to learn this twelve-fold division from
Grecian astronomers after the date of Alexander’s
conquest.</p>

<p>But again as regards the fixation of the initial<span class="pagenum" id="Page104">[104]</span>
point of the distinctively Indian Lunar Zodiac, or
circle of the Nakshatras, at the “end of Revatî,
and the beginning of Açvinî,” that is to say, at
a point not far from the first degree of Aries—cuneiform
tablets teach us the important fact that
long before the equinoctial point coincided with
any of the degrees of Aries, that constellation was
the leader of the Zodiacal series—inasmuch as
the month Bar zig-gar (Accadian) the “Sacrifice of
righteousness,” that is, the month when the sun
was in conjunction with Aries, always in the tablets
appears as the 1st month of the year.<a id="FNanchor52" href="#Footnote52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote52" href="#FNanchor52" class="label">[52]</a> This fact is admitted (see art. “Zodiac,” sub-heading “first
sign,” <i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i>). But it is a fact opposed to the
hitherto received opinion touching the necessary connexion of
the equinoctial point and of the initial point of the Zodiac. “A
prehistoric reform” of the calendar is supposed, and corrections
of the ancient texts to suit this reform, are suggested. Until
traces of such reform and corrections can be shown to exist,
the evidence of the tablets may still be cited as pointing to a
year counted from the sun’s entry into Aries, in the earliest
ages of Babylonian civilization.</p>

<p>These late revelations of archæology seem to
strike at the root of the main arguments relied on
by the advocates of the Grecian and modern origin
of astronomic science in India; and this being the
case, it is possible to turn with unbiassed minds<span class="pagenum" id="Page105">[105]</span>
to a consideration of the teachings of Sanscrit
literature, and endeavour to learn from them what
is the real truth as to the acquaintance of ancient
Indian authors with the figures of the Zodiac and
other astronomic phenomena.</p>

<p>The opinion has been very generally adopted,
as has been said, that in the Rig Veda there is no
mention of any of the twelve figures of the Solar
Zodiac. Some few writers have contended that
occasional references to these figures are to be met
with, and this question has been argued on
etymological grounds. My entire ignorance of
the Sanscrit language prevents me from at all
following the arguments employed in this discussion.
And here it may be said, and said with
good reason, that for the discussion of points
connected with Vedic literature, writers ignorant
of the language in which the Vedas were composed
are but ill equipped for the task. At every
step I keenly feel my own disqualifications; but
many translations and commentaries on the Rig
Veda are in existence; and without entering into
etymological questions, it has seemed to me that
broad astronomic explanations of some of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page106">[106]</span>
myths might be supplied, if only the possibility
of the Vedic Rishis having been acquainted with
the strange figures of the celestial sphere should
be admitted. In this paper I am anxious to
draw the attention of those who can study Vedic
texts in their original language to these possible
explanations. Those only who know Sanscrit are
really qualified to judge finally whether the suggestions
here made can be sustained on further
enquiry into the Vedas. If the interpretations
of Vedic myths here proposed are correct—no
doubt corroboration will be found for them in the
Sanscrit names and epithets of mythic personages.
If no such corroborations are to be met with,
the probabilities in favour of the correctness of
the astronomic interpretations will be greatly
diminished.</p>

<p>But to return to our subject. It is sometimes
argued that the Vedic bards could not have been
acquainted with the twelve-fold division of the
Zodiac, as otherwise these great constellations
would surely have claimed at their hands clear
and outspoken notice. With this argument I
cannot fully agree. Even before pointing out<span class="pagenum" id="Page107">[107]</span>
the important place which I believe astronomical
phenomena hold in the Rig Veda, I would draw
attention to the fact that according to the generally
received and non-astronomic explanation of the
myths, it is necessary to suppose that still more
striking and important natural phenomena than
those connected with the constellations of the
Zodiac—phenomena with which the Vedic bards
must certainly have been acquainted—were almost
entirely ignored by the authors of the Rig Veda.
It is true that some great scholars claim on
linguistic grounds a solar origin for much Vedic
imagery and nomenclature; yet when the hymns
are examined in translations, and the notes and
commentaries which accompany these translations
are studied, the impression left on the mind of
any reader unacquainted with Sanscrit must be
that very little attention or honour is given to
sun, moon, or stars, in comparison to that so freely
lavished on the elements of fire, air and water,
and on the mysterious properties of the juice of
the Soma plant.</p>

<p>The beauty of the dawn is almost the only
celestial glory that appears to appeal with any<span class="pagenum" id="Page108">[108]</span>
insistence to the imaginations of the Vedic
Rishis.</p>

<p>If out of the more than one thousand hymns of
the Rig Veda, not one is addressed to the moon,
and on the most liberal calculation considerably
less than a hundred to the sun, under any aspect,
it need not be cause for wonder if the constellations
of the Zodiac are not remembered. The poets
of the Rig Veda, however ignorant of astronomy,
and at whatever age they lived, must have sometimes
lifted their eyes above the sacrificial fire and
its smoke, above the rain and storm-clouds, above
their altars and libations of Soma. They must
have often seen “the sun when it shined” and
“the moon walking in brightness,” and if they so
rarely hymned these great luminaries with whose
appearance and existence they so certainly were
acquainted, it would prove no ignorance on their
part of the twelve-fold division of the Zodiac and
its quaintly imagined figures, were it indeed the
case that all mention of these figures is absent
from the Rig Veda.</p>

<p>But as has been stated above, my desire is to
draw attention to possible astronomic interpretations<span class="pagenum" id="Page109">[109]</span>
of many of the Vedic myths, and the
adoption of such interpretations would necessarily
entail a reversal of the dictum that all mention of
the twelve-fold Zodiac is absent from the Rig Veda.</p>

<p>Those who have studied this wonderful and
mysterious collection of hymns most constantly
and deeply are obliged to confess that it is still
very imperfectly understood, and though it is
agreed unanimously that the Gods of the Veda
are personifications of the phenomena of nature,
yet as to the exact phenomena underlying the
various Vedic myths there is among scholars
much difference of opinion. It is impossible not
to feel in reading the hymns and the many
speculations, notes, and comments appended to
them, that notwithstanding all the labour and
research bestowed on the work, much of this
ancient Veda still remains a cypher, for the right
understanding of which the modern reader does
not possess the key.</p>

<p>Guided by the teachings of archæology, I
now make the suggestion that the key to this
cypher may perhaps be found in crediting the
authors of the Veda with a somewhat advanced<span class="pagenum" id="Page110">[110]</span>
knowledge of astronomy, and an acquaintance with
the, to us, apparently fanciful constellations of the
celestial sphere and Zodiac; and in assuming
that the figures of the “ancient constellations”
often supplied the basis of Vedic imagery.</p>

<p>To pursue this possible clue towards the understanding
of the myths, it were much to be desired
that all students should be acquainted with the
names and positions in the heavens of the forty-five
constellations—so well distinguished by the epithet
“ancient”—and that they should master some of
the more easily observed conditions of their diurnal
and annual apparent movements, as also those of
the sun and moon, and further that they should
have learnt what changes in the scenery of the
heavens have been brought about by the slow
movement known to astronomers as the “precession
of the equinoxes.”</p>

<p>Classical and philological scholars have however
so rarely time and attention to spare from
their own intensely interesting and important
studies that as a rule astronomical phenomena are
not much observed or considered by them. The
accompanying diagrams drawn from a celestial<span class="pagenum" id="Page111">[111]</span>
precessional globe may, it is hoped, enable those,
who have not as yet devoted thought to such
subjects, to judge for themselves of the reasonableness
or otherwise of the following astronomic
suggestions concerning the most important of the
Vedic gods.</p>

<p>According to A. A. Macdonell—who in his
late work <i>Vedic Mythology</i> has summed up
clearly and compendiously the opinions of a host
of scholars on the nature of the Vedic gods—Indra
is the favourite national god of the Rig
Veda; he is celebrated in 250 hymns, a greater
number than that “devoted to any other god,
and very nearly one-fourth of the total number
of hymns in the Rig Veda.”<a id="FNanchor53" href="#Footnote53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>What may be called the central myths related
of Indra, stripped of all epithet and ornament,
relate that, invigorated by copious draughts of
Soma, Indra fights with, overcomes, and drives
from heaven and earth a demon called Vritra
or Ahi, who is represented under the form of a
dragon, serpent or water snake. Indra also
searches for, finds, and releases cows which had<span class="pagenum" id="Page112">[112]</span>
been stolen from the gods (or according to some
commentators, from the angirasas, or priests).
Indra bestows on his worshippers all the blessings
of plenty, especially he is the dispenser of
rain.</p>

<p>According to the usual non-astronomic explanations
of these myths, Indra, an “atmospheric
god,”<a id="FNanchor54" href="#Footnote54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> is “primarily the thunder god” who
conquers “the demons of drought or darkness,”
or again, “Indra<a id="FNanchor55" href="#Footnote55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> is a personification of the
phenomena of the firmament, particularly in the
capacity of sending down rain. This property is
metaphorically described as a conflict with the
clouds which are reluctant to part with their
watery stores until assailed and penetrated by
the thunder-bolt of Indra; ... the cloud is
personified as a demon named Ahi or Vritra
... a popular myth represents him (Indra) also
as the discoverer and rescuer of the cows, either
of the priests or of the gods which had been
stolen by an <i>Asura</i> named Pan̂i or Vala.”</p>

<p>Macdonell, alluding to the same incident, observes:<a id="FNanchor56" href="#Footnote56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page113">[113]</span>
These “cows released by Indra may,
in many cases, refer to the waters, for we have
seen that the latter are occasionally compared
with lowing cows. Thus Indra is said to have
found the cows for man when he slew the dragon....
But the cows may also in other cases be
conceived as connected with Indra’s winning of
light, for the ruddy beams of dawn issuing from
the blackness of night are compared with cattle
coming out of their dark stalls. Again, though
clouds play no great part in the Rig Veda under
their literal name (<i>abhra</i>, etc.), it can hardly be denied
that, as containing the waters, they figure mythologically
to a considerable extent under the name
of cow (<i>go</i>), as well as udder (<i>ūdhar</i>) ... thus
the rain-clouds are probably meant when it is
said that the cows roared at the birth of Indra.”</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>At the close of the section devoted to Indra,
Macdonell refers to the probably pre-Vedic origin
of the Indra myths. He says:<a id="FNanchor57" href="#Footnote57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> “The name of
Indra occurs only twice in the Avesta. Beyond
the fact of his being no god, but only a demon,<span class="pagenum" id="Page114">[114]</span>
his character there is uncertain. Indra’s distinctive
Vedic epithet <i>vrtrahan</i> [Vritra-slayer] also occurs
in the Avesta in the form of <i>verethraghna</i>, which
is, however, unconnected with Indra or the thunderstorm
myth, designating merely the God of Victory.
Thus it is probable that the Indo-Iranian period
possessed a god approaching to the Vedic form
of the Vrtra-slaying Indra. It is even possible
that beside the thundering god of heaven, the
Indo-European period may have known as a
distinct conception a thunder-god, gigantic in size,
a mighty eater and drinker, who slays the dragon
with his lightning bolt.”</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>In reading the Indra hymns in the Veda, and
in trying to fit them to the explanation given in
the passages quoted, a constant and very disagreeable
strain is put on the imagination; it
must, for instance, attempt to grasp and hold, at
the same time, two very far apart opinions as to
the nature of the demon Vritra. Vritra is to be
thought of as a demon of darkness, and as a
demon of drought; the cows are clouds, they are
also ruddy beams of light!</p>

<p>Darkness and drought are not to be easily<span class="pagenum" id="Page115">[115]</span>
bracketed together. Drought is in all lands, India
not excepted, connected with a long continuance
of bright and stainless skies. The appearance
then of a little cloud “like a man’s hand” is the
joyously hailed precursor of “the sound of abundance
of rain.”</p>

<p>Again, the driving away of a snake-like cloud
is no forcible simile by which to describe in myth
the advent of rain in India—rain which to be of
any use is no mere refreshing shower, but a long-continued
downpour from clouds not hastily
dispersed.</p>

<p>Indra’s action first in driving away the cloud-demon
Vritra, and then in seeking for the beneficial
cloud cows, is also contradictory.</p>

<p>For the reconciling of many of these contradictions
the astronomic interpretation of the Indra-Vritra
myths is as follows:—Indra may still retain
all his atmospheric attributes of sending down rain
but—<i>Indra is primarily and essentially a personification
of the summer solstice</i>.</p>

<p>The summer solstice in India is an all-important
agricultural epoch; it brings with it “the rainy
season,” the real spring of the Indian year. Before<span class="pagenum" id="Page116">[116]</span>
this season all the land is parched and arid, and
vegetation is at a standstill.</p>

<p>The punctuality of the rains in many parts of
India is so exact that the farmer foretells their
arrival not only to the day, but to the hour. In
good years heavy and almost incessant rain lasts
for two or even three months. Indra, as a personification
of the season which so punctually
brings the rain, is an atmospheric god, the enemy
of the demon of drought. But Indra is more than
this: many praises are bestowed on Indra in the
Rig Veda for deeds which cannot easily be explained
on the simple atmospheric theory. “Indra
is the highest of all” is the refrain of many
Vedic verses; “Indra placed the sun high in the
sky,” “Indra tore off one wheel of the sun’s
chariot,” “Indra stopped the tawny coursers of
the sun.” Now all these phrases are at once
and clearly to be interpreted if we think of Indra
as the personification of the summer solstice, and
especially of the solstice in India, where at that
season of the year the sun attains to the very
zenith, and thus Indra associated with the <i>sun</i>
under one figure of speech is spoken of as “highest<span class="pagenum" id="Page117">[117]</span>
of all,” and in a slightly varied figure associated
with the <i>season</i>, is said to have “<i>placed</i> the sun
high in the sky.” Or again translating into myth
the very meaning of the word solstice or “<i>the
sun being made to stand</i>,” we read that Indra
“tore off the wheel of the chariot of the sun,”
and “stopped his tawny coursers.” Indra is, I
cannot but believe, not merely an atmospheric
god; he is the god of the summer solstice. And
if this should be the case, what then may Vritra
be? Is the demon of the solstitial Indra personified
as only a snake-like cloud? It is impossible
to think so. The astronomic interpretation of the
myth I would propose is that—<i>a snake-like
constellation</i>, not a snake-like cloud, is the representation
of the demon Vritra.</p>

<p>On the celestial sphere many serpents and
dragons are represented, but the far-reaching
constellation Hydra exceeds all the others in its
enormous length from head to tail. No very
brilliant stars mark the asterism, nor in the
grouping of its stars is there anything especially
snake-like. For some reason other than its appeal
to the eye did astronomers of old invest with all<span class="pagenum" id="Page118">[118]</span>
the horrors of the Hydra-form the monotonous
length of this space on the vault of the skies.</p>

<p>This reason may be arrived at, with almost
certainty, in studying, with the help of a precessional
globe, the position in the heavens of this
constellation in different ages of the world’s history.
So studying, we shall find that 4,000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>—or
to be more precise, one or two hundred years
earlier—Hydra extended its enormous length for
more than 90° symmetrically along one astronomically
important (though invisible) mathematical
line—the line of the heavenly equator—and
was at the same date accurately bisected
by another equally important mathematical line,
namely the colure of the summer solstice (see
<a href="#PlateIX">Plate IX.</a>).</p>

<p>Almost irresistibly, as it appears to me, the
conviction forces itself on the mind, in considering
the position held by the constellation Hydra
4,000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>, that it was at that date that this baleful
figure was first traced in imagination on the sky,
there fitly to represent the power of physical (and
may we not suppose also, of moral?) darkness—a
great and terrible power—but a power ever and<span class="pagenum" id="Page119">[119]</span>
ever again to be conquered by the victorious
power of light. In astronomic myth this power
was represented as that of the sun at the season
of its highest culmination, the season of the
summer solstice. For an observer in the temperate
northern zone all through the long nights of mid-winter,
the whole length of the dreadful Hydra
was at the date named visible above the horizon.
The dark midwinter season was therefore the
time of the Hydra’s greatest glory. At every
season of the year, except at that of midsummer,
some portion of the monster’s form was visible
during some part of the night. But at the summer
solstice no star in the constellation might show
itself for ever so short a time.<a id="FNanchor58" href="#Footnote58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

that the Indra-Vritra myth cannot be claimed with

is a probability that “the Indo-Iranian period possessed
a god approaching to the Vedic form of the
Vrtra-slaying Indra,” and that “it is even possible

<p>For the <i>origin</i> of this world-wide myth, therefore,
we should not look to the tropical Indian Zone;
but it is in Indian latitudes that we should look for
an explanation of the physical phenomena <i>hymned
by Vedic bards in the distinctly Indian development
of the Indra-Vritra myth</i>. I believe that in thus
tracing the course of the Indra story from temperate
to tropical latitudes, we shall find a reason
for the contradictory attributes assigned to the
demon Vritra, namely those of darkness and
drought.</p>

<p>In northern latitudes winter is distinctly the
<i>dark</i> season; in tropical India there is little or no
perceptible difference between the darkness of
winter and summer. But in India winter is distinctly
the dry season. Midsummer is the all-important
season of the rains. Indra’s conquest
over Vritra, or the arrival of solstitial rains, marked
by the disappearance of the constellation Hydra
from the sky, was mythologically in the Vedas
described as Indra’s conquest over the demon
of <i>drought</i>, but still traditionally—for the power of
tradition is great—even in India Indra retained the
attributes of the conqueror over the demon of
<i>darkness</i>.</p>

<p>But if Indra is to be considered as representing

constellation Hydra, we must surely expect some
astronomic interpretation for Soma—Soma by which<span class="pagenum" id="Page122">[122]</span>
the mighty Indra is invigorated and enabled to
triumph gloriously over the demon. According to
non-astronomic explanations, “the concrete terrestrial
plant and the intoxicating juice extracted
therefrom” are considered to be the basis of the
mythology of Soma. It is admitted that in post-Vedic
literature Soma is a regular name of the
moon, which is regarded as being drunk up by
the gods, and so waning. Some writers point to
the possibility that even in the Rig Veda, “in
the Soma hymns there may occasionally lurk a
veiled identification of ambrosia and the moon,
... but on the whole, with the few exceptions
generally admitted, it appears to be certain that
to the seers of the Rig Veda the god Soma
is a personification of the terrestrial plant and
juice.”<a id="FNanchor60" href="#Footnote60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>That Soma in the Rig Veda is primarily the
moon, and that the moon is symbolized and always
more or less directly referred to in the Vedic
hymns to Soma, fits in, as must be evident to
the readers of this paper, with the astronomic
theories advocated in it. If we consider that
Indra’s conquest over Vritra represents the god
of the summer solstice, with his bright weapons,
conquering, and driving from heaven and earth
the constellation Hydra, we can easily understand
how in this contest Indra might be strengthened
by copious draughts of Soma, <i>i.e.</i> by the bright
light of the full moon flooding the heavens with
radiance and enfeebling all but the brightest
stars.</p>

<p>But a further confirmation of the lunar character
of Soma, and an elucidation of the imagery of the
Soma pavamāna hymns of Maṇḍala IX., are to be
found if—still crediting the Vedic Rishis with a
knowledge of the ancient constellations—we study
the position of these constellations at the date<span class="pagenum" id="Page124">[124]</span>
3,000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span> (see
<a href="#PlateXI">Plate XI.</a>)<a id="FNanchor62" href="#Footnote62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> At that date the full
moon of the midsummer or solstitial season was
always to be observed in the constellation Aquarius.
With this thought in our mind as we read the
mystical hymns of Maṇḍala IX., in which Soma
is so often described as rushing impetuously to
the vase or pitcher, and as surrounded by celestial
waters, with many other such expressions, we
easily recognise an allusion to the <i>midsummer full
moon in the constellation Aquarius</i>; and when
further we read the legend so often repeated, that
the eagle brought the Soma to Indra, or to the
sacrifice, we have only to look at the celestial
globe to see the eagle (Aquila) directing its flight
towards the pitcher of Aquarius—and to remember
that the very night before the moon attained the
celestial vase, it would have been on the same
meridian as the constellation Aquila; and the
imaginative Vedic bard might then describe it as
borne along by the eagle,—one of the most
glorious constellations in that part of the sky.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote62" href="#FNanchor62" class="label">[62]</a>
Lunar dates are variable. The full moon <i>nearest</i> to the
summer solstice might have been observed somewhat to the
east or the west of its position in the diagram, but always
in the constellation Aquarius.</p>

<p>In one hymn especially devoted to the legend
of the Soma-bearing eagle (or hawk), allusion to
the small but well-marked-out constellation Sagitta
(the arrow) may be detected. In Wilson’s translation
of Maṇḍala IV. 27 (vol. iii. p. 174), we read:
“When the hawk screamed (with exultation) on his
descent from heaven, and (the guardians of the
<i>Soma</i>) perceived that the <i>Soma</i> was (carried away)
by it, then, the archer Kriṣánu, pursuing with the
speed of thought, and stringing his bow, let fly an
arrow against it.”</p>

<p>Now to turn to another important Vedic deity,
Agni.</p>

<p>Agni is classed, according to Macdonell, amongst
terrestrial gods, but he points out that in some
passages he is to be identified with the sun.
Wilson describes Agni as comprising<a id="FNanchor63" href="#Footnote63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> “the element
of <i>Fire</i> under three aspects: 1<sup>st</sup>, as it exists on
earth, not only as culinary or religious fire, but as
the heat of digestion and of life, and the vivifying
principle of vegetation; 2<sup>nd</sup>, as it exists in
the atmosphere, or mid-heaven, in the form of<span class="pagenum" id="Page126">[126]</span>
lightning; and 3<sup>rd</sup>, as it is manifested in the
heavens, as light, the sun, the dawn, and planetary
bodies.” And—having enumerated various deities
who in the hymns appear as manifestations of the
sun—he adds, “still, however, the sun does not
hold that prominent place in the <i>Vaidik</i> liturgy
which he seems to have done in that of the ancient
Persians, and he is chiefly venerated as the
celestial representative of Fire.”</p>

<p>The classification of Agni as a terrestrial god,
given by Macdonell, and the order of his “aspects,”
as given by Wilson, are not in accordance with
the theory here advocated, nor, according to
Macdonell, is it the classification or order always
adhered to by Vedic authorities.</p>

<p>For some very puzzling myths concerning Agni, I
believe an astronomic interpretation may be given, and
thereby the position of Agni in the <i>first</i> place, rather
than in the <i>last</i>, as a celestial god, may be established.</p>

<div class="quote">

<p>The Vedic deity Apām Napāt—the son of
Waters, is classed by Macdonell as an atmospheric
god, and he says,<a id="FNanchor64" href="#Footnote64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> “In the last stanza of the Apām
napāt hymn, the deity is invoked as Agni, and
must be identified with him,” and again,<a id="FNanchor65" href="#Footnote65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>
“Agni’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page127">[127]</span>
origin in the aerial waters is often referred to.
The ‘son of waters’ has, as has been shown,
become a distinct deity.” Then turning to other
legends regarding Agni he says, “In such passages
the lightning form of Agni must be meant. Some
of the later hymns of the Rig Veda tell a legend
of Agni hiding in the waters and plants, and being
found by the gods.... In one passage of the
Rig Veda also it is stated that Agni rests in all
streams; and in the later ritual texts, Agni in the
waters is invoked in connexion with ponds and
water-vessels. Thus, even in the oldest Vedic
period, the waters in which Agni is latent, though
not those from which he is produced, may in
various passages have been regarded as terrestrial....
In any case the notion of Agni in the waters
is prominent throughout the Vedas.”</p>

<p>To explain this legend, Wilson makes other suggestions.
He writes:<a id="FNanchor66" href="#Footnote66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> “The legend of his (Agni’s)
hiding in the waters, through fear of the enemies of
the gods, although alluded to in more than one place,
is not very explicitly related ... the allusions of
the <i>Súktas</i> (hymns) may be a figurative intimation
of the latent heat existing in water, or a misapprehension
of a natural phenomenon which seems to
have made a great impression in later times—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page128">[128]</span>
emission of flame from the surface of water either
in the shape of inflammable air, or as the result
of submarine volcanic action.”</p>

<p>It cannot but be admitted that these myths are
puzzling, and that to account for the notion so
prominent throughout the Vedas of “Agni in the
waters,” the various suggestions of “lightning,”
“latent heat existing in water,” “the emission of
flame from the surface of the waters, either in the
shape of inflammable air or as the result of submarine
volcanic action,” are inadequate to explain
the fact that Agni, whose very name “is the
regular designation of fire”<a id="FNanchor67" href="#Footnote67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> should in the hymns
be so closely associated with water. Nor are the
difficulties concerning “Agni in the waters” to be
overcome by the tempting and poetic suggestion,
put forward by some writers, that in these passages
reference is made to the sun rising in the
morning out of the ocean, and again hiding itself
beneath the waves at sunset. The composition
of the Rig Veda is attributed to Aryan settlers
“scattered over the Punjaub and regions lying
to the west of the Indus”: by such settlers the<span class="pagenum" id="Page129">[129]</span>
sun could never have been seen <i>rising</i> out of the
ocean, for no ocean bounded their horizon on the
east. Even the phenomenon of the sun hiding
itself at evening in the water, could only have been
observed by those who lived on the western <i>coast</i>,
and it is therefore not easy to imagine why sunrise
and sunset should in India have been so closely
and constantly associated with a sea horizon.</p>

<p>But if once the acquaintance of the originators
of the Agni myths with the Zodiacal figures is
admitted, the astronomic interpretation of those
relating to Agni in the waters is not difficult; it
is as follows:</p>

<p>Agni is the personification of fire, but his chief
personification is as the fire of the sun. <i>“Agni
in the waters” is especially the fire of the sun in
the celestial waters of Aquarius.</i> 3,000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span> the
sun was in conjunction with Aquarius at the time
of the <i>winter solstice</i>.<a id="FNanchor68" href="#Footnote68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> Those hymns therefore
which dwell upon the myths of Agni hiding himself
in, being born in, and rising out of the waters,<span class="pagenum" id="Page130">[130]</span>
may be considered as hymns referring to <i>the sun at
the winter solstice in conjunction with the constellation
Aquarius</i>, and therefore as hymns especially
suitable for use on the occasion of a great yearly
festival held at that season of the year.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote68" href="#FNanchor68" class="label">[68]</a>
The position of the sun at the <i>winter solstice</i> 3,000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>
was identical with that represented at <a href="#PlateXI">Plate XI.</a> as the position of
the full moon at the <i>summer solstice</i>.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>European writers often describe the mid-winter
sun as <i>hiding</i> itself, or as every day withdrawing
itself more and more from view. In poetic similes,
the snows of winter often crown the head of the
aged out-going year, while the in-coming year is
represented as a <i>babe</i> or <i>infant</i>. The appropriateness
of such similes is due to the fact, that our
calendrical new year is fixed within a few days of
the winter solstice. Again, in sober prose, the
sun at the time of the winter solstice is said,
having attained its lowest point, <i>to rise</i> or <i>begin
its upward course</i> on the ecliptic. It is therefore
not difficult to understand how the Vedic Rishis,
who appear to have combined the characteristics
of poets and of scientific observers of the heavens,
should have 3,000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span> described <i>the fire of the
solstitial sun, as hiding in, being born in, and
rising out of the celestial waters of the constellation
Aquarius</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page131">[131]</span></p>

<p>In this Agni myth, as in that of Indra, we
may perceive traces of a pre-Vedic origin. The
latitudes in which the Rig Veda was composed are
not those in which attention is forcibly drawn to
the diminution of the strength and visibility of
the sun at the winter season. In the Rig Veda,
however, Indra’s conquest over darkness as
well as over drought is celebrated, and the
same <i>traditional</i> cause may be assigned for the
description of Agni hiding himself at the time of
the winter solstice in the waters of Aquarius.</p>

<p>Indra, Soma, and Agni no longer hold the
important place in the Hindu Pantheon which
they appear to have held in Vedic times, and on
the astronomic theory, this fact may partly be
accounted for by noticing how slow but inevitable
changes in the scenery of the heavens, produced
by the precession of the equinoxes, gradually
obscured more and more completely the meaning
of the <i>imagery</i> employed in the hymns to these
deities. Indra, if he represents the summer solstice,
is indeed still as powerful as ever, and
still triumphs over the demon of drought, but
no longer is that demon well represented by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page132">[132]</span>
snake-like constellation Hydra; for on the night
of the summer solstice, after the sun has set, the
whole of Hydra is still above the horizon. No
longer does the mid-summer full moon bathe its
brightness in the celestial waters of Aquarius,
nor does the mid-winter sun hide itself in them.
The hymns remain, the phenomena they referred
to, exist no longer.</p>

<p>But leaving now the subject of the “ancient
constellations” and of reference to them in the
Rig Veda, let us turn to the second section of the
argument in favour of the modern origin of
Hindu astronomy as stated above.<a id="FNanchor69" href="#Footnote69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> It is a claim
made for the very modern date of 570 <span class="smcapall">A.D.</span> as
that for the fixation of the initial point of the
Indian Zodiac at the “end of Revatî and the
beginning of Açvinî.”—This claim I desire to
oppose.</p>

<p>It has been admitted by scholars, but almost
with a sort of reluctance, that mention is made of
some of the Nakshatras in a few of the Rig Veda
hymns. The matter is rather avoided than
cordially enquired into. It is, however, a question<span class="pagenum" id="Page133">[133]</span>
of great and important interest to ascertain, if
possible, whether the circle of the Nakshatras was
known to the Vedic Rishis, and if it were known,
whether the initial point was fixed there, where
as we have read, <i>all schools of Hindu astronomy
agree in declaring that the planetary motions commenced
at the creation</i>.<a id="FNanchor70" href="#Footnote70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>We have learnt from Babylonian archæology
that we are no longer forced to assume that only
at the date of about 570 <span class="smcapall">A.D.</span> could this initial
point have been fixed by Indian astronomers.
It therefore need no longer be looked upon as
an unreasonable quest to search in the ancient
pages of the Rig Veda for indications that this
important astronomical point had been fixed,
even before Vedic times, as the starting-point
of a calendrical and sidereal year—and if we
should find such indications in the Rig Veda,
they may well out-weigh arguments against the
antiquity of this fixation, based upon passages in
later works, such as the Yajur and Atharva Vedas.</p>

<p>From the Yajur Veda itself, arguments may
be drawn in favour of a year beginning in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page134">[134]</span>
month Chaitra,<a id="FNanchor71" href="#Footnote71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> at or before the date of the composition
or compilation of that Veda.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote71" href="#FNanchor71" class="label">[71]</a> Chaitra is the month which begins, as closely as a luni-solar
month may, at the sun’s arrival at the initial point of the Hindu
Zodiac—the beginning of Aswinī.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>In the Taittirîya Sanhitâ (contained in the
Yajur Veda) a passage occurs<a id="FNanchor72" href="#Footnote72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> which is translated
and commented upon by B. G. Tilak (<i>The Orion,
or Antiquity of the Vedas</i>, p. 46 <i>et seq.</i>). In this
passage is discussed the superior suitability of
three different days on which worshippers might
consecrate themselves for the yearly sacrifice.
Not any one of these three days has any connexion
with the <i>spring equinox</i> or the sun’s
conjunction with Krittikā. The choice of date
for the yearly sacrifice appears to lie between, first,
the “Ekâṣhṭakā (day)” of some month not named,<a id="FNanchor73" href="#Footnote73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
but one in the “distressed,” or “reversed” period
of the year, <i>i.e.</i> the mid-winter season; second, the
full moon of Phalgunī; and third, the Chaitra full
moon. B. G. Tilak, after some pages of comment
on the passage referred to, states in his summing<span class="pagenum" id="Page135">[135]</span>
up, amongst others, the following conclusions which
he has arrived at.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote72" href="#FNanchor72" class="label">[72]</a> Taittirîya Sanhitâ, vii. 4. 8.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote73" href="#FNanchor73" class="label">[73]</a>
At p. 48 he quotes authorities in favour of the Ekâṣhṭakā (day)
in this passage meaning the 8th day of the dark half of Mâgha.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>“1<sup>st</sup>, that in the days of the Taittirîya Sanhitâ
the winter solstice occurred before the eighth day
of the dark half of Mâgha ... and that throughout
the whole passage the intention of sacrificing at
the beginning (real, constructive, or traditional) of
the year is quite clear: ... 2<sup>nd</sup>, that the year
then commenced with the winter solstice”: “3<sup>rd</sup>,
that as there can not be three real beginnings
of the year, at an interval of one month each, the
passage must be understood as recording a tradition
about the Chitrâ full moon and the Phalgunī
full moon being once considered as the first days
of the year.”</p>

<p>This is B. G. Tilak’s conclusion; merely
judging from the <i>translation</i>, the passage might,
as it seems to me, be understood as unreservedly
recommending the full-moon of Chaitra as the
most suitable for the beginning of the sacrifice,
for in the text of the Taittirîya Sanhitâ it is said
of it, “It has no fault whatsoever.”</p>

<p>But in whichever sense the words are understood,
this passage from the Yajur Veda may be
set against the hymns and lists in the Yajur and<span class="pagenum" id="Page136">[136]</span>
Atharva Vedas, above alluded to,<a id="FNanchor74" href="#Footnote74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> in which
Krittikā is celebrated in the first, and Aswinī
in the twenty-seventh place.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>The fact that the evidence as to the beginning
of the year “in the days of the Taittirîya Sanhitâ,”
is, as it seems, so uncertain, and so contradictory
to the opinion based on the hymn in the Taittirîya
Brāhmana concerning Krittikā being the leader of
the Nakshatras, seems to add interest to the
question whether there are, or are not, indications
in the Rig Veda that the Indian year was
counted from the same point on the ecliptic as
at present?<a id="FNanchor75" href="#Footnote75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote75" href="#FNanchor75" class="label">[75]</a> At present the month Chaitra in most parts of India is the
first month of the Hindu year. The beginning of the year is
measured by the return of the sun to the same point in the
Zodiac: at present the beginning of the Lunar Mansion Aswinī.
(See <i>Indian Calendar</i>, p. 45.)</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>And at once, as it seems to me, on turning to the
Rig Veda, on page after page, such indications are
to be met with.</p>

<p>The first Nakshatra in the Indian series is named
Aswinī (Aswins). The two chief stars in that Nakshatra
are the twin stars, as they may fairly be<span class="pagenum" id="Page137">[137]</span>
called, α and β Arietis—stars of almost equal
radiance. The joyous hymns addressed to the
twin heroes, the Aswins, I would claim as new-year
hymns composed in honour of these <i>stars</i>,
whose appearance before sunrise heralded the
approach of the great festival-day of the Hindu
new year.</p>

<p>The Hindu year is a sidereal year. It is counted
at present in most parts of India from a fixed point
on the ecliptic, not from a season. It is a
calendrical not a cosmic year. Only one apparently
small change in the method of counting the years
would now require to be made, and again the
Aswins might be hymned by the Hindus as the
“wondrous,” and “not untruthful,” <i>stars</i>, marking
by their heliacal rising a new year’s festival—a
festival to be held on the 15th, or full moon’s
day.</p>

<p>The Hindu year is now counted from the new
moon immediately <i>preceding</i> the sun’s arrival at
the initial point of the lunar Zodiac. The first of
Chaitra (the first of the light half of Chaitra) never
falls later than the 12th of April, and may arrive a
month earlier. If the year were to be counted from<span class="pagenum" id="Page138">[138]</span>
the same initial point, but from the first new moon
<i>following</i> instead of that <i>preceding</i> the sun’s arrival
at that point, there would be the difference of a
whole month in the range of the month Chaitra.
The first day of its bright half would then never
arrive before the 12th of April, and might fall a
month later.</p>

<p>For the interpretation of the Vedic hymns to
the Aswins I would make the provisional suggestion,
that when these hymns were composed, the year
was so counted from the new moon <i>following</i> and
not from that <i>preceding</i> the arrival of the sun at
“the end of Revatî and the beginning of Açvinî.”
In support of this provisional theory, let us first
read the summing up of the Aswinī myths, and of
the difficulties and uncertainties surrounding them,
according to the present modes of explanation; and
then let us consider the astronomic method of
interpretation above proposed.</p>

<p>We read that<a id="FNanchor76" href="#Footnote76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> “Next to Indra, Agni, and Soma,
the twin deities named the Aśvins are the most
prominent in the Rig Veda, judged by the frequency
with which they are invoked. They are celebrated<span class="pagenum" id="Page139">[139]</span>
in more than fifty entire hymns and in parts of
several others, while their name occurs more than
400 times. Though they hold a distinct position
among the deities of light and their appellation
is Indian, their connexion with any definite
phenomenon of light is so obscure, that their
original nature has been a puzzle to Vedic interpreters
from the earliest times. This obscurity
makes it probable that the origin of these gods is
to be sought in a pre-Vedic period.... The
Aśvins are young, the T. S. (Taittirīya Sanhitâ)
even describing them as the youngest of the gods.
They are at the same time ancient. They are
bright, lords of lustre, of golden brilliancy, and honey-hued....
They possess profound wisdom and
occult power. The two most distinctive and frequent
epithets of the Aśvins are <i>dasra</i>, ‘wondrous,’
which is almost entirely limited to them, and
<i>nāsatya</i>, which is generally explained to mean
‘not untrue....’ Their car ... moves round
heaven. It traverses heaven and earth in a single
day as the car of the sun and that of Uṣas (the
Dawn) are also said to do.... The time of their
appearance is often said to be the early dawn, when
‘darkness still stands among the ruddy cows’ and
they yoke their car to descend to earth and receive
the offerings of worshippers. Uṣas (the Dawn)<span class="pagenum" id="Page140">[140]</span>
awakes them. They follow after Uṣas in their car.
At the yoking of their car Uṣas is born. Thus
their relative time seems to have been between
dawn and sunrise. But Savitṛ (the sun) is once
said to set their car in motion before the dawn.
Occasionally the appearance of the Aśvins, the
kindling of the sacrificial fire, the break of dawn,
and sunrise seem to be spoken of as simultaneous.
The Aśvins are invoked to come to the offering
not only at their natural time, but also in the
evening or at morning, noon, and sunset....
In the A. B. (Aitareya Brahmana) the Aśvins as
well as Uṣas and Agni are stated to be gods of
dawn; and in the Vedic ritual they are connected
with sunrise.... The Aśvins may originally
have been conceived as finding and restoring or
rescuing the vanished light of the sun. In the
Rig Veda they have come to be typically succouring
divinities.” ... Again, at p. 51, the writer
adds, “Quite a number of legends illustrating the
succouring power of the Aśvins are referred to
in the Rig Veda.” Here follows an enumeration
of many miraculous “protections,” and cures,—and
then<a id="FNanchor77" href="#Footnote77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> “The opinion of Bergaigne and others that
the various miracles attributed to the Aśvins are
anthropomorphized forms of solar phenomena (the<span class="pagenum" id="Page141">[141]</span>
healing of the blind man thus meaning the release
of the sun from darkness), seems to lack probability.
At the same time the legend of Atri may be a
reminiscence of a myth explaining the restoration
of the vanished sun. As to the physical basis of
the Aśvins, the language of the Ṛṣis is so vague
that they themselves do not seem to have understood
what phenomenon these deities represented
... what they actually represented puzzled
even the oldest commentators mentioned by
Yāska. That scholar remarks that some regarded
them (the Aśvins) as Heaven and Earth (as does
the S. B.—Satapatha Brahmana), others as Day
and Night, others as sun and moon, while the
‘legendary writers’ took them to be ‘two kings,
performers of holy acts.’ Yāska’s own opinion is
obscure.”</p>

them as addressed to well-known and beneficent
deities presiding over the new year—deities who
manifested themselves in the earliest dawn of the
new year’s morning under the form of two beautiful
and easily to be recognised <i>stars</i>, and to whom their
worshippers appealed for “protection,” through the
unknown dangers of the future year.</p>

<p>I give two diagrams to illustrate the fact that
the time of the rising of the stars α and β Arietis must
necessarily, on such a new year’s festival as above
proposed, have taken place in some years before
the first intimation of dawn, in others a few minutes
before the time of sunrise.</p>

<p>It is of course to be borne in mind that the
Vedic years were luni-solar. The actual point
therefore on the ecliptic at which the conjunction
of sun and moon-or new moon-took place, and
from which each year was counted, varied in
different years to the extent of nearly 30 degrees.
The diagram, <a href="#PlateXII">Plate XII.</a> Figs. 1 and 2, represents the
maximum and minimum distance between the rising
of the Yoga stars of the Nakshatra Aswinī, and of
the sun on the 15th or full-moon’s day of the first
month of a luni-solar year; counted from the first<span class="pagenum" id="Page143">[143]</span>
conjunction of sun and moon <i>following</i> the sun’s
arrival at the “end of Revatî and the beginning of
Açvinî.”</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>It will be seen from the diagram that something
more than two hours was the longest interval that,
according to the presumed method of counting the
Vedic year, elapsed between the appearance of α and
β Arietis and of the sun above the horizon.</p>

<p>This astronomic interpretation accounts for the
varying times noted in the hymns for the appearance
of the Aswins. It also accounts, as it seems to me,
for the general tone of the hymns, but as regards
the long series of miraculous “protections” of the
Aswins, accorded by them to many sick, aged, and
decrepit personages, it does not at first sight
account.</p>

<p>We have seen that Bergaigne and others have
opined that the various miracles attributed to the
Aswins are “anthropomorphized forms of solar
phenomena,” and with this view the astronomic
interpretation, when fully followed out to its logical
end, agrees.</p>

<p>But at first sight we wonder how the sun at
the beginning of the calendrical year could, <i>in</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page144">[144]</span>
<i>Vedic times</i>, be described as in any way especially
sick, aged, or decrepit.</p>

<p>3,000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>, when, as we have seen, the winter
solstice was in Aquarius, the Indian calendrical
and sidereal year, such as has been supposed,
would have begun at its earliest a month and a
half <i>after</i> the solstice.<a id="FNanchor78" href="#Footnote78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> The sun <i>at</i> the winter
solstice, may be, and often is, described as pale,
weak, sick and old; but at the beginning of a
calendrical year, a month and a half <i>after</i> the
solstice, the sun no longer could have been thought
of as requiring the miraculous protection of the
heralding Aswins.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote78" href="#FNanchor78" class="label">[78]</a> If the Hindu year were <i>now</i> counted from the new moon
<i>following</i> instead of that <i>preceding</i> the sun’s arrival at the initial point
of the Zodiac, owing to the precession of the equinoxes, the year
would begin at earliest twenty-one days after the <i>spring equinox</i>.
Since 3,000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span> the seasons have advanced by more than two
months, as regards their position amongst the stars.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>To help in solving this difficulty, recourse may
again wisely be had to Babylonian astronomic lore.
The fanciful legends regarding the Aswins, considered
only by themselves, can scarcely yield a
sufficiently firm foundation on which to build the
far-reaching theory I now desire to bring forward<span class="pagenum" id="Page145">[145]</span>
concerning them; a theory on all fours with one I
ventured some years ago to propound in reference
to Babylonian astronomy, in a Paper entitled
the “Accadian Calendar.”<a id="FNanchor79" href="#Footnote79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> It was there suggested
that the probable date for the origin of
that Calendar was about 6,000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span> The fact was
pointed out that Aries, in the most ancient Accadian
and Babylonian astronomical works, always appears
as leader of the signs and of the year, and stress
was laid on the unlikelihood that this constellation
should have been chosen for this leading post at
a date when the sun’s entry into it did not correspond
with any one of the four well-marked natural
divisions of the year, <i>i.e.</i> the solstices or equinoxes.
But as on the cuneiform tablets Aries appears as
<i>leader</i> long before the time when the sun sojourned
in that constellation during the first month following
<i>the equinox</i>, it was suggested that it was when the
<i>solstitial not the equinoctial</i> point coincided with
the first degree of Aries, that the Accadian
calendrical scheme had first been drawn up;
namely about 6,000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote79" href="#FNanchor79" class="label">[79]</a>
<i>Proceedings of Society of Biblical Archæology</i>, January 1892.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>A corroboration of the view then put forward<span class="pagenum" id="Page146">[146]</span>
is to be drawn from a further study of the
Accadian month names. The first three month
names, in Accadian, referred, as scholars have
pointed out, to the first three constellations of the
Zodiac.</p>

<p>(1.) The month of the “sacrifice of righteousness”
to Aries.</p>

<p>(2.) The month of the “propitious Bull” to
Taurus.</p>

<p>(3.) The month of “the Twins” to Gemini.</p>

<p>The twelfth and thirteenth names in the same
series seem to refer equally clearly to a year
originally counted as beginning at the <i>winter
solstice</i>. They are called respectively:</p>

<p>“12th. The month of sowing of seed.”—“13th.
The dark month of sowing.”</p>

<p>For the sowing of most cereals, late autumn
and early winter are the favoured seasons. Many
crops however are sown in early spring. There
might then be a doubt whether “the month of
sowing of seed” more fitly described the spring
sowing of seed in the twelfth month of a luni-solar
year, counted from the <i>equinox</i>,—or the winter
sowing of seed in the twelfth month of a luni-solar<span class="pagenum" id="Page147">[147]</span>
year, counted from the <i>solstice</i>. But when we
find this twelfth month followed by a thirteenth,
of which the especial and added epithet is <i>dark</i>,
there can, as it seems to me, be little if any doubt
that the winter month whose range in different
years extended from 12th of December to 22nd
January is better described by the epithet dark,
than the rapidly brightening month whose range
extended from 12th March to 22nd April.</p>

<p>Very curiously, then, and accurately does the
Accadian calendar give us the date of its origin,
and of the first naming of its months, as that
when the <i>winter solstice coincided with the sun’s
entry into the first degree of the constellation Aries</i><a id="FNanchor80" href="#Footnote80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>—the
date in round numbers of 6,000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote80" href="#FNanchor80" class="label">[80]</a> The winter solstice now coincides very closely with the
sun’s entry into Sagittarius. It <i>precedes</i> the sun’s entry into Aries
by almost a third of the whole circle of the ecliptic.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>To this same date it is, as I believe, that
the miraculous protections accorded by the Aswins
to the <i>distressed</i> solstitial sun and moon and
earth appear to point, and fully does this view
corroborate the opinion that the Aswin-legends
took their rise in pre-Vedic times. They also,<span class="pagenum" id="Page148">[148]</span>
as do the Indra and Vritra myths, refer us for
their origin to a more northern latitude than
tropical India. In the tropics the sun is scarcely
less powerful in winter than in summer. The
astronomers who drew up the Accadian calendar,
and the myth-makers of the Aswin-legends, must,
according to the astronomic theory, have dwelt
in temperate zones and formulated calendar and
myths about 6,000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span></p>

NOTES.—AHURA MAZDA, ETC.</h3>

<p class="reprint">[Ahura Mazda, a note reprinted from the <i>Proceedings of the Society
of Biblical Archæology</i>, February 1900]</p>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>Professor Hommel in the March number for 1899
of these <i>Proceedings</i> calls attention in his <i>Assyriological
Notes</i> to the name “Assara Mazas” appearing
in a list of Assyrian gods. The section of the
list in which this name appears contains “a number
of foreign sounding names” belonging to gods
honoured, presumably, in out-lying portions of the
Assyrian dominions.</p>

<p>Professor Hommel claims “that this god (Assara
Mazas) is no other than the Iranian Ahura Mazda,”
and he thus concludes his arguments in favour of
this opinion—“concerning <i>Assara-mazas</i>, I should
like to remark in closing this paragraph, that we
have here the same older pronunciation of Iranian<span class="pagenum" id="Page150">[150]</span>
words as in the Kassitic <i>Surias</i>, ‘sun’ (later <i>Ahura</i>
and <i>Hvarya</i>, but comp. Sanscrit <i>Asura</i> and <i>suria</i>),
which is of the highest importance for the history of
the Aryan languages. In the same Kassitic period,
between 1,700 and 1,200 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>, I suppose was borrowed
by the Assyrians the Iranian god Assara-mazas.”</p>

<p>In a Paper entitled <i>The Median Calendar and
the Constellation Taurus</i>, printed in the June number
for 1897 of these <i>Proceedings</i>, I made a very
similar claim for the derivation of the name of the
great god of the Assyrians—Assur.</p>

<p>The claim put forward was not based only on
the resemblance in sound of “Assur” and “Ahura,”
but was in the first place founded on the virtual
identity of the emblems of Assur and Ahura Mazda.
For the <i>origin</i> of these emblems (referring as it was
suggested they did to the Zodiacal constellation
Sagittarius) a date as high as 4,000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span> was, on
astronomic grounds, assumed, and it was pointed
out that at that date there was no evidence of the
existence of the Assyrian nation as a nation, nor
any trace of a Semitic worship of the god Assur;
whereas, on the other hand, as early as 3,800 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>
there is evidence that a powerful Aryan race—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page151">[151]</span>
Manda—rivalled the power, and threatened the
Semitic rule of Sargon of Agane.</p>

<p>The opinion that the symbol of Ahura Mazda,
and of Assur, was of ancient Aryan origin, naturally
suggested the further thought that the <i>name</i> Assur,
so closely resembling the earlier Indo-Iranian form
Asura, of the Iranian Ahura, had, together with the
emblem of the god, been borrowed from the Aryan
ancestors of the Medo-Persians by the Semitic
settlers who, early in the second millennium <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>,
established themselves to the north of Babylonia.
It may here be pointed out that no very certain
Semitic derivation at present holds the field which
the proposed Aryan derivation would occupy.
According to some scholars it comes from a word
signifying “a well-watered plain.” According to
Professor Hommel, the name Assur is derived from
a word which originally meant “the heavenly
host.”</p>

<p>Professor Hommel, quoting as his authority the
opinions of the Sanscrit scholar Oldenburg, and reinforcing
Oldenburg’s opinions by arguments from
other sources, further maintains the high probability
of the Median god Ahura Mazda having been the<span class="pagenum" id="Page152">[152]</span>
representative of the Vedic Varuna, and also that
Varuna was the moon.</p>

<p>Vedic scholars are divided in opinion as to what
physical phenomenon is represented by Varuna. He
is very generally supposed to personify “the vast
extent of the encompassing sky,” some say especially
the sky at night-time—others claim him as a solar
divinity, whilst Oldenburg, as we have seen, supposes
him to be the moon. It is not to the question,
however, what phenomenon Varuna represented,
but to that of the probability or improbability of
his original identity with the Median Ahura Mazda,
that I would now draw attention.</p>

<p>It is said that “the parallel in character, though
not in name, of the god Varuna is Ahura Mazda,
the Wise Spirit.” But a variety of considerations
may lead us to entertain the possibility of a Vedic
god other than Varuna being the parallel in character
and in <i>epithet</i> of Ahura Mazda; a parallel which
is also still more clearly to be recognized if we
adopt the view, above contended for, of the identity
of Assur, the <i>archer</i> god of Assyria, with Ahura
Mazda.</p>

<p>The Vedic god Rudra is, like Varuna, an Asura<span class="pagenum" id="Page153">[153]</span>
or Spirit. He is described as “the wise,” and his
votaries are encouraged to worship him “for a comprehensive
and sound understanding.” But in one
passage the epithet “asura maha,” so curiously
recalling to our ears the name of the Avestan
“Ahura Mazda,” is actually applied to him.<a id="FNanchor81" href="#Footnote81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> As
a wise and great Asura, Rudra seems to be as close
a parallel to Ahura Mazda as Varuna; the resemblance<span class="pagenum" id="Page154">[154]</span>
of epithet in the case of Rudra makes the
parallelism closer.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote81" href="#FNanchor81" class="label">[81]</a> Wilson,
<i>Rig Veda</i>, Maṇḍala ii., I, 6, Uncertainty prevails
among scholars as to the exact meaning to be given to the name
Ahura Mazda. The Rev. L. H. Mills, D.D., under the heading
“Zend,” writes thus in <i>Chambers’s Encyclopædia</i>; “The Supreme
Deity Ahura Mazdâh, the Living God or ‘Lord’ (<i>ahu</i> = ‘the
living,’ ‘life,’ or ‘spirit’—root <i>ah</i> = ‘to be’), the Great Creator
(<i>maz</i> + <i>da</i> = Sansk. <i>mahâ</i> + <i>dhâ</i>), or ‘the Wise One’ (<i>cf.</i> <i>su-medhâs</i>).”
Again, the same writer in his book on the Gàthàs, published in
1894, gives on p. 3 in his “verbatim translation,” “O magni-donator
(?) (vel) O Sapiens (?),” as alternative meanings for
Mazda. Similar uncertainty seems to prevail as regards the
meaning to be attached to the words of the passage in the Rig
Veda to which reference has been made above, <i>i.e.</i>, Maṇḍala ii.,
Súkta i., verse 6. In Wilson’s translation of the Rig Veda,
vol. ii., p. 211, we read:—“Thou, Agni, art Rudra, the expeller
(of foes) from the expanse of heaven”: and in his note to this
passage he says: “<i>Twam Rudro asuro maho divah</i>: <i>asura</i> is
explained śatrúnám nirasitá, the expeller of enemies, <i>divas</i>, from
heaven; or it may mean, the giver of strength....” Macdonell
(<i>Vedic Mythology</i>, p. 75) says that Rudra is called in this passage
“the great <i>asura</i> of heaven.”</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>Varuna indeed in Vedic estimation held a much
higher and more commanding position than Rudra,
but considering how opposed the Avestan was to
Vedic mythology on important points, we ought not
to expect that the god elevated by the Medians
above all others should have held a very exalted
place amongst the Brahmins of India.</p>

<p>But it is when we turn our thoughts not only to
Ahura Mazda but to his Assyrian representative
Assur, that the parallelism between him and Rudra
becomes more marked.</p>

<p>Rudra is not only a wise and great Asura, he is
above everything else celebrated in the Rig Veda as
an archer. He has “the sure arrow, the strong
bow.”<a id="FNanchor82" href="#Footnote82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> He is “the divine Rudra armed with the
strong bow and fast flying arrows.”<a id="FNanchor83" href="#Footnote83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>In the Paper already referred to, it was
suggested that an astronomic observation of the
equinoctial colure passing through the constellations
Sagittarius and Taurus was the probable origin of<span class="pagenum" id="Page155">[155]</span>
Median and (as derived from Median) Assyrian
symbolism concerning Ahura Mazda and Assur.
This observation could, as was pointed out, only
have been made at the date, in round numbers, of
4,000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span></p>

<p>It is a very tempting enterprise to seek in the
mythologies of European nations for allusions to
this same astronomic observation—an observation
made, as we may believe, when the ancestors of the
Iranian and Indian Aryans, and possibly the ancestors
of the European nations, were still, if not all
dwelling together, at least within easy intellectual
touch of each other.</p>

<p>In Grecian fable we have the Centaur (the Bull-killer)
Chiron giving his name to the constellation
Sagittarius, and in this fable we may, as it would
seem, find a better <i>astronomic</i> explanation of the
term Bull-killer than that usually given concerning
the well-mounted Thessalian hunters of wild cattle.
The constellation Sagittarius, an archer, half man,
half horse, is not a figure of Grecian invention.
It is to be met with depicted on Babylonian monuments,
unmistakably the archer of our celestial
sphere; and this constellation, when it rises in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page156">[156]</span>
east, always drives below the western horizon—<i>i.e.</i>,
mythically exterminates, the last stars of the constellation
Taurus.</p>

<p>To Chiron, the chief Centaur, the epithet “wise”
is especially given, and “he was renowned for his
skill in hunting, medicine, music, gymnastics, and
the art of prophecy”; of these not altogether congruous
attributes Rudra the Vedic god possessed
three of the most important. He was wise, he was
an archer, and he was famed as “a chief physician
among physicians.”<a id="FNanchor84" href="#Footnote84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> In a verse, part of which has
been already quoted,<a id="FNanchor85" href="#Footnote85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> worshippers are exhorted to
“Praise him who has the sure arrow, the strong
bow, who presides over all sanitary drugs; worship
Rudra for a comprehensive and sound understanding,
adore the powerful divinity with prostrations.”</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>Apollo the far-darter, Artemis the goddess of
the silver bow, also shared these same attributes,
and Grecian legend would lead us to place them in
the same part of the heavens as that allotted to
Chiron—<i>i.e.</i>, Sagittarius. Apollo prompted Artemis
to aim a shaft from her bow at a point on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page157">[157]</span>
horizon, and this point was the head of the hunter
Orion. Now the constellation Orion is exactly
in opposition to the bow stars of Sagittarius;
that the legend is astronomical is plainly to be
inferred from its variant form, in which Artemis
is represented as sending a Scorpion to sting
Orion to death. The stars marking the Scorpion’s
sting are in very close proximity to the bow stars of
Sagittarius.</p>

<p>Returning to Indian myths, the name of Siva
does not occur in the Rig Veda; but in later
Sanscrit works Siva is the representative of Rudra.
In a hymn to Siva,<a id="FNanchor86" href="#Footnote86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> the following passages occur,
and it is difficult to read them and not be reminded
of the sculptured figures of Artemis, crescent-crowned
and leading a stag by the horns. (Allowance
must be made, however, for the tendency in
Hindu art to multiply the heads, arms, and features
of their gods.)</p>

<p>For the explanation of the Roman myths of
Dianus and Diana (varying forms as the dictionary
tells of Janus and Jana) we may naturally seek
for the same astronomic origin, as for those concerning
the Grecian archer divinities.</p>

<p>Janus indeed has not, so far as I know, ever
been represented as an archer or a Centaur. The
attribute for which he is especially renowned is that
of “opener of the year,” and this attribute, on the
astronomic theory here proposed, would furnish the<span class="pagenum" id="Page159">[159]</span>
connecting link between the varying forms of the
Italian deities above mentioned.</p>

<p>The many and still imperfectly understood
changes that were made in the Roman year by
successive rulers, have effaced the connexion of
that year with the stars which must have originally
presided over its opening. But Roman tradition
embodied in Virgil’s lines speaks of “the bright
Bull” who “with his gilded horns opens the year.”<a id="FNanchor87" href="#Footnote87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>
The golden star-tipped horns of the Bull are as we
know exactly opposed to the westernmost degrees
of Sagittarius; and that constellation, in opposition
to the sun, would therefore have marked the opening
of just such a vernal year as that alluded to by
Virgil. Whether this vernal year before the Julian
reformation was still the calendrical year in Rome
is, however, very doubtful.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote87" href="#FNanchor87" class="label">[87]</a> Virgil, <i>Georg.</i>, Lib. I., 217, 218.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>Janus is represented with two heads, sometimes
even with four, “to typify the seasons of the year.”
The <i>full moon</i> in Sagittarius 4,000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span> marked the
season of the spring equinox—the sun then being
in <i>conjunction</i> with the stars marking the horn tips
of the Bull. The <i>new moon</i> in Sagittarius at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page160">[160]</span>
same date marked the autumn equinox. The
<i>half waning moon</i> in Sagittarius marked the season
of the winter solstice: and the half moon of the
<i>crescent or waxing moon</i> marked the season of the
summer solstice. The four heads of Janus may
thus have referred to the four seasons marked by
the moon in Sagittarius.</p>

<p>The fact that the Indian archer Rudra (= Siva)
and the Grecian archer Artemis, were represented
as crowned by the <i>half</i>, not the <i>full moon</i>, would
refer these myths to an Indo-Iranian, not to a somewhat
later Iranian source. It was not to the
reformed Iranian equinoctial year that they pointed,
but to the sun’s triumph at the solstitial season. In
the Roman Janus myth we may rather detect the
later Median influence, and suppose that it referred
to a year beginning with the <i>full moon</i> in Sagittarius,
a year opening in the spring, when the <i>sun</i>
was in conjunction with the “gilded horns” of “the
bright Bull.”</p>

<p>All these mythological indications, derived from
Median, Assyrian, Indian, and classical sources,
though each of them looked at separately may not
speak with much insistence, yet considered together<span class="pagenum" id="Page161">[161]</span>
seem to point us more and more clearly as we study
them, to the fact that about 4,000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span> a very important
and authoritative observation of the colures
(amongst the Zodiacal constellations) was made, and
that upon this observation much of the mythology
of ancient nations was founded.</p>

<p>It is only on Talmudic authority, I think, that
astronomy can be denied a place, and indeed an
important place, in researches connected with
Biblical Archæology.</p>

<p>On Talmudic authority we are told that, as a
protest against the sun-, moon-, and star-worship of
surrounding nations, the Hebrews were not permitted
to calculate in any way beforehand, or by
scientific methods based on the movements of the
heavenly bodies, their days, their months, or their
years.</p>

<p>The end of the day and beginning of the night
could only be definitely ascertained when three
stars were visible to the observer. The moon must<span class="pagenum" id="Page163">[163]</span>
have shown its pale sickle to some watcher of the
heavens, before the first of the month could be
announced. The beginning of the year, we are
also told, was dependent on the earliness or lateness
of the agricultural season, for three ears of
corn, in a sufficiently advanced state of growth,
were to be presented to the priest and waved before
the Lord <i>on a fixed day of the first month</i> of the
year.</p>

<p>This is what some passages of the
Talmud<a id="FNanchor88" href="#Footnote88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page164">[164]</span>
seem to teach; but from Old Testament Scriptures,
it is not possible to infer these calendrical restrictions
with any degree of certainty. On the contrary,
there is much in the Scriptures to lead us
to an opposite conclusion.</p>

<i>Bible Educator</i>, edited by Rev. E. H. Plumptre, M.A., vol.
iii. pp. 239 and 240. “It may have been with a view to render
astrology impossible, that the Jews were forbidden to keep a
calendar in the Holy Land, ... as the length of the lunation,
or lunar month, is, roughly speaking, twenty-nine days and a half,
it is easy to know, from month to month, when to expect the
crescent to become visible. Six times in the year the beginning
of the month was decided by observation of the new moon....
On two months of the year the determination of the new moon
was of such importance, that the witnesses who observed the
crescent were authorized to profane the Sabbath by travelling
to give information at Jerusalem. These occasions were the
months Nisan and Tisri.... The Mishna records that on one
occasion as many as forty pairs of witnesses thus arrived on the
Sabbath at Lydda. Rabbi Akiba detained them, but was reproved
for so doing by Rabbi Gamaliel.... When the evidence was
satisfactory, the judges declared the month to be commenced,
and a beacon was lighted on Mount Olivet, from which the signal
was repeated on mountain after mountain, until the whole country
was aglow with fires.”</p>

<p>On the very first page of the Bible we read of
“the greater and the lesser lights,” and of “the stars
also” set in the heavens, to be “for signs, and for
seasons, and for days and years.” And scarcely
have we turned this first page, when we meet the
statement that “in process of time it came to pass,
that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an
offering unto the Lord. And Abel, he also brought
of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof.
And the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his
offering.” In the margin the words “in process
of time” are rendered “at the end of days.” In
considering this passage we seem to be brought
into touch with a definitely established year;
and at once archæology and astronomy enter into
the field of Biblical research, to tell us of a remotely
old calendar—astronomic indications would date the
origin of this calendar at about 6,000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>—and
from this calendar we learn that at “the end of<span class="pagenum" id="Page165">[165]</span>
days”—the end of the <i>dark</i> days of the year—there
followed a month of “the sacrifice of
righteousness”: a sacrifice, we may well suppose,
of the firstlings of the flock, as the stars in conjunction
with the sun during this first month were
imagined by the institutors of the calendar under
the form of a lamb or ram ready for sacrifice.</p>

<p>To this calendrical first month our attention is
again drawn when we read, in the book of Exodus,
of the institution at God’s command of the Hebrew
festival, to be held on the 14th and 15th days of
the month Abib.</p>

<p>This month Abib, it is generally assumed, is
the equivalent of the month Nisan, spoken of in
some of the later books of the Old Testament.</p>

<p>Astronomy and archæology again claim a
hearing on this point. The month Nisan, the
Semite equivalent of the Accadian month Bar zig-gar
(the month of the “sacrifice of righteousness”),
we may gather from the evidence of the cuneiform
tablets, had been the first month of a calendrical
year in Babylon for many centuries—for millenniums,
perhaps—before the date of Moses; and therefore
archæology would teach us that the children of Israel<span class="pagenum" id="Page166">[166]</span>
were being recalled, from strange Egyptian modes
of reckoning, to the observance of an ancient and
patriarchal year and festival, when they were told
that for them Abib was to be the first month of the
year, and that on the 14th of that month, “a night
to be much observed,” they were to sacrifice of the
firstlings of their flock, and were to hold the great
festival of the Passover on the fifteenth day.</p>

<p>If “Abib,” “Nisan,” and “Bar zig-gar” are
names used by various nations to designate one and
the same month, Abib could not have been, as has
very generally been supposed, a month varying
according to the uncertain ripening of agricultural
crops, and one taking its name from the <i>ears of corn</i>
presented to the priest, and waved before the Lord
on some fixed day of that month; but rather it
must have been (as we know, from Babylonian
sources that Nisan was) a well calculated soli-lunar
and sidereal month. Now, if we adopt this view,
we must find some alternative derivation for the
month name Abib. Nor is it by any means
difficult so to do.</p>

<p>On the fourteenth night of the first month—Bar
zig-gar, Nisan, or Abib—“a night to be much<span class="pagenum" id="Page167">[167]</span>
observed,” or rather, according to the marginal
reading, “a night of observations”—the bright
star Spica, which marks the <i>ears of corn</i> in the
Virgin’s hand, rose above the eastern horizon as
the sun set in the west, and at midnight must
have shone down brilliantly on the Hebrew hosts;
for Spica is so bright a star, that even the beams
of the full moon riding close at hand could not
have obscured its lustre.</p>

<p>The Indians of to-day name their months from
the stars in their lunar Zodiac which are in
<i>opposition to</i>, not from those in <i>conjunction with</i>,
the sun. The close resemblance of the Arab and
Indian lunar Zodiacal series suggests the thought
that the Arabs may have followed the same
system of month <i>nomenclature</i> as the Indians;
and if this were the case it would furnish a reason
why Moses, who had so lately returned from his
forty years’ sojourn in Arabia, should—in recalling
the Hebrews to the observance of such a year
as that which was presumably followed by their
forefathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob—have yet
spoken of the first month of the year according
to a <i>non-Babylonian</i> method of nomenclature, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page168">[168]</span>
should have called it Abib, after the star in
<i>opposition to</i> the sun.</p>

<p>If now we adopt the opinion that an astronomic
method of counting the year did in reality obtain
amongst the Hebrews, a great difficulty must
present itself to our minds in regard to the
generally accepted theory that only on a <i>fixed day
of the first month of the year</i> might the first
reaped handful of corn be waved before the
Lord.</p>

<p>The seasons in Palestine are not more punctual
than in other countries. To restrict a husbandman
to a fixed day of a year (even such a year as
ours) before which he might not begin to put
his sickle into the corn, would be felt as a hurtful
and arbitrary regulation; but to restrict the
husbandman to a fixed day in a luni-solar year
would be a still more hurtful regulation. The
beginning of a soli-lunar year may vary to the
extent of a whole month. A late beginning of
such a year might coincide with a very early
agricultural season, and <i>vice versa</i> an early
calendrical year might occur in a late agricultural
season.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page169">[169]</span></p>

<p>Considerations of this nature may incline us
to inquire carefully whether the “generally accepted
theory” (concerning the waving of the ears of
corn before the Lord during the Passover week)
rests upon Scriptural authority or on Talmudic and
traditional teaching. As against an almost unbroken
array of commentators, it is possible in this
connexion to quote from the work of a learned
Hebrew scholar a clearly expressed opinion that
from the Scriptures themselves, it is not possible
to infer directly a connexion in date between the
waving of the first fruits and the Passover festival.<a id="FNanchor89" href="#Footnote89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote89" href="#FNanchor89" class="label">[89]</a> <i>Pentateuque</i>, Traduction Nouvelle, par Rabbi Wogue
(Lazare), tom. 3. Discussing an important difference of opinion
which exists amongst Jewish scholars and commentators as to the
exact day of the Passover festival, on which the priest was to wave
the sheaf before the Lord, the writer says: “Le texte porte: ‘Le
Lendemain du Sabbat,’ indication qui a donné lieu à une dissidence
importante entre les Pharisiens et les Saducéens.... Nous avons
adopté le système talmudique, qui a pour lui l’autorité des Septante,
des targoumîm, de Josephe, et l’usage immémorial de la Synagogue;
mais, à ne consulter que les textes sans parti pris, nous ne souscririons
à aucune des deux doctrines. Ni la cérémonie de l’ômer,
ni le comput des semaines, ne sont mis par nos textes en rapport
avec la Pâque, mais uniquement avec les moissons, soit ici, soit
dans le Deutéronome (xvi. 9). Dès la récolte de l’orge, le divin
Législateur veut qu’on lui fasse hommage des prémices de cette
céréale; il n’indique point de date, parceque la moisson, pas plus
que la vendange, et pas plus en Palestine qu’ailleurs, ne commence
à jour fixe. Mais une fois ouverte, elle se continue sans interruption;
et comme les froments, en Palestine, sont coupés sept
semaines après, les prémices du froment doivent être offertes au
bout de sept semaines. L’Omer et la Pentecôte sont donc mobiles
par exception, mais cette dernière est relativement fixe. Maintenant
de quel ‘Sabbat’ est il question? Puisque tout ici est
subordonné à <i>l’ouverture de la moisson</i>, ce sera naturellement le
Sabbat qui suit cette ouverture.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page170">[170]</span></p>

<p>But if our enquiries should lead us to accept,
as at least a probability, the existence in Mosaic
times of an astronomically counted Hebrew year,
and if this admission should require us to change
long-held opinions regarding the right observance
of Hebrew festivals, on the other hand,
the fact that we might then trace <i>Arabian</i> rather
than <i>Babylonian</i> influence in the name of Abib
would have its weight on the conservative side of
the controversy concerning the post or pre-exilic
<i>date</i> of the books of Exodus and Deuteronomy.</p>

<p>The fact that in India the months are named
after the stars in opposition to the sun suggested
the above proposed explanations of the Hebrew
month name Abib as that of the month when the
sun was in conjunction with the constellation Aries,
and in opposition to the star Spica, marking the
Zodiacal ears of corn. But there is a further point<span class="pagenum" id="Page171">[171]</span>
of connexion to be observed between Indian
astronomy and Biblical archæology, namely, that
the <i>first month of the Indian year</i> is at the
present date the month during which the sun is
in conjunction with the constellation Aries. This
month is called Chaitra, which is the Sanscrit
name of the star Spica, and it is in fact the same
sidereally marked month, which, according to the
opinions here advocated, was the first month of
the ancient Accadian, Babylonian, and Hebrew
years.</p>

<p>It must, therefore, be a question of interest to
Biblical students to determine, if possible, whether
this Indian <i>first month</i> has only so been counted
(as some scholars tell us) since about 570 <span class="smcapall">A.D.</span>, or
whether it has so been counted from the same
remote time as was the Accadian month Bar zig-gar,
that is, possibly, from about 6,000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span></p>

<p>This question as to the month Chaitra forms
part only of a larger controversy which has been
long waged, concerning the antiquity, or otherwise,
of the whole science of astronomy in India.</p>

<p>To this larger controversy I have drawn attention
in my Paper, <i>Astronomy in the Rig Veda</i>, read<span class="pagenum" id="Page172">[172]</span>
before the Congress of Orientalists assembled at
Rome in 1899. In that Paper, arguments are put
forward in support of the opinion that the Vedic
bards possessed an acquaintance with the science
of astronomy, and that much of the imagery of
the hymns bore reference to the constellations of
the Zodiac. For the gods Indra, Soma, Agni,
and the Aswins, astronomic interpretations are
proposed; and finally the question, which as it
seems to me is one specially deserving the attention
of the Society of Biblical Archæology—the question
of the position of the month Chaitra as first
month of the Indian year in Vedic and pre-Vedic
times is discussed, and the claim that it was, and
throughout remote ages had ever been, virtually
the same month as the Accadian Bar zig-gar is
insisted upon.</p>

<p>Pursuing further the controversy concerning the
antiquity of astronomy amongst the Aryan races, in
the <a href="#Footnote81">note</a> on “Ahura Mazda” (<a href="#Page152">p. 152</a>), I proposed an
identification of the Vedic Rudra with the Median
god—the god who presided over the Median equinoctial
year, marked by observation of the full moon
in the constellation Sagittarius.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page173">[173]</span></p>

<p>Continuing then our enquiries into the astronomic
myths of ancient India, let us turn our
attention to the sons of Rudra—the <i>Maruts</i>.
They are a group of gods very prominent among
Vedic deities, and it is to be noted that Rudra is
oftener alluded to in the Rig Veda as the father of
the Maruts than in almost any other capacity. Now
the Maruts—the stormy troop of Maruts—are
celebrated as the companions and friends of Indra.
They are “associated with him in innumerable
passages.” Here, at first sight, it might seem that
the proposed astronomical identification of Indra
and Rudra as solstitial and equinoctial personifications
must break down; for how should the
sons of the equinoctial Rudra always appear as
the devoted companions of the solstitial Indra?</p>

<p>On further examination, however, a very
interesting explanation of this difficulty presents
itself. From a hymn (quoted at <a href="#Page157">p. 157</a>) to Siva,
the Hindu representative of the Vedic Rudra, we
learn that the crescent half-moon blazes on the
forehead of Siva. Now the crescent half-moon, in
the western degrees of the constellation Sagittarius,
would, 4,500 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>, have marked the month of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page174">[174]</span>
summer solstice; for the moon, in its “first
quarter” in the first degrees of Sagittarius, must
attain to “full moon” seven days later, either in
the constellation Aquarius or Pisces, and the
full moon in one or other of those two constellations
marked the season of the summer solstice
somewhat earlier than 4,000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span> The Maruts
are often spoken of in the Veda as a troop, seven
in number, or as seven troops of seven, or as
three times seven in number. The astronomical
thought therefore suggests itself, that the seven
Maruts represent the seven days that elapsed
between the crescent half-moon, blazing on the brow
of Rudra, and the full moon of the summer solstice,
or Soma pavamana—Soma purified in the celestial
waters (see <a href="#PlateXIII">Plate XIII.</a>). And this explanation of
the Maruts does not contradict, but rather agrees
with and includes the usual non-astronomic explanations
held regarding them, namely, that they
are <i>storm winds</i>; for we know that the days
which accompany the setting in of the solstitial
rainy season in India are the days in which the
fierce tropical hurricanes or monsoons prevail.</p>

<p class="faceref">[<i>To face p. 174.</i></p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>Now let us turn from the Maruts to another, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page175">[175]</span>
it seems to me, lunar and solstitial myth, namely,
that of Trita Aptya.</p>

<p>Trita Aptya is a friend of the Maruts, and is
said to have appeared on the same car with them.
He is constantly, in the hymns, associated with
Indra, and feats recorded in one passage as performed
by Indra, are in another passage of the
same hymn attributed to Trita.</p>

<p>Trita is also often spoken of together with
Soma; and in the ninth Maṇḍala, again and again
we read of the ten “maidens, or fingers,” of Trita
preparing the Soma juice for Indra.</p>

<p>All these attributes of Trita, and others to be
mentioned later, are easily explainable on the
astronomic theory already propounded in the
identifications of Indra, of Soma, and of the
Maruts.</p>

<p>In the name Trita there is certainly a suggestion
of the number <i>three</i>, and Macdonell, in his <i>Vedic
Mythology</i>,<a id="FNanchor90" href="#Footnote90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> brings proof to show “that it was
felt to have the meaning of the third”—that is, in
order of sequence.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote90" href="#FNanchor90" class="label">[90]</a> P. 69.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>But though the third, in this sense, does not<span class="pagenum" id="Page176">[176]</span>
actually carry with it the meaning of <i>third of a
whole</i>; yet, to any one in search of an astronomical
explanation of the Trita myth, the reiterated
mention of the ten fingers of Trita quickly suggests
the thought of a whole divided into three
chief parts, each part containing ten lesser divisions—a
whole therefore of thirty parts.</p>

<p>Now the lunar month—in reality consisting of
twenty-nine and a half solar days (with some
fractions over)—is in Hindu calendrical usage
divided into thirty equal portions of time called
“tithis,” which are considered as lunar days; and
here, as it would seem, we arrive at the physical
basis of the Trita myth. Trita Aptya, or Trita in
the waters (or of the waters), appears as the third
part of the lunar month—the part during which
the moon is to be seen in the celestial waters; and
as Trita is so closely connected with Indra and
Soma pavamana, that third part must have been
the ten lunar days (five before and five after “the
full”) during which the moon is at its brightest, and
in the constellation Aquarius.</p>

<p>If we think of Trita Aptya as a personification
of the triumphant third of the moon’s course through<span class="pagenum" id="Page177">[177]</span>
the constellations of the Zodiac at the season of the
summer solstice (see <a href="#PlateXIII">Plate XIII.</a>), and if we remember
that the moon during the ten lunar days
contained in that “third” came to its full in
Aquarius or in Pisces, sometimes indeed at the
juncture of these constellations, we shall be able
to understand much of the figurative language of
the Veda, which associates Trita with the stormy
Maruts, with the victories of Indra over Vritra,
and with the effulgence of Soma pavamana.</p>

<p>There is a legend concerning Trita not related
but alluded to in the Rig Veda. This legend tells
us that Trita was one of three brothers (Ekata,
Dvita, and Trita), and that he was pushed into a
well by his brothers, and over the mouth of the well
a circular covering was placed with intent to keep
Trita down and drown him. But through the
circular covering the ever-triumphant Trita burst.
Here there can be little doubt is a mythic description
of the temporary disaster of eclipse overtaking
the full moon of the summer solstice in the celestial
waters of Aquarius or Pisces. The circular
covering can be nothing else than the circular
shadow of the earth covering the disc of the full<span class="pagenum" id="Page178">[178]</span>
moon, and Trita’s triumph may well remind us of
the serene victoriousness of the moon when it has
emerged from eclipse and rides unharmed along the
sky.</p>

<p>In the Zend Avesta Thrita corresponds in
many points with the Vedic Trita. Thraetona
also represents Trita under some of his other
aspects, and mention is made of Thraetona’s “two
brothers who seek to slay him on the way.”<a id="FNanchor91" href="#Footnote91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>
From these facts it may be inferred that the
Trita myth is pre-Vedic. We need not, therefore,
be surprised to find traces of it in European
mythologies. The name of Trita, with only a
change of termination, appears as the Greek
Triton, and we may guess at an allusion in the
sculptured forms of Greek and Roman Tritons—half
men and half fish—to the two watery constellations,
Aquarius and Pisces, in which the
Vedic Trita Aptya (son of waters) made his abode.
The Roman rendering of these composite figures,
especially, may recall to our minds the Zodiacal
basis of the myth—the two fish of Pisces
appearing in Italian art, as the two fish-tails<span class="pagenum" id="Page179">[179]</span>
which terminate the human-headed figure of the
Triton. Again Hecate, as has been pointed out
by scholars, bears a close resemblance in name
to Ekata. Hecate was a lunar divinity; she was
worshipped and sacrificed to at the close of the
month. We may therefore suppose she represented
the waning moon. She is further said to
have been the daughter of Perseus and Asteria.
Looking at the figures of the celestial sphere (see
Plate), we may trace the third part of the moon’s
course—the ten days of its waning appropriated to
Ekata—and observe how this portion of its course
began close to the <i>constellation Perseus</i>. Thus the
Sanscrit Trita myth may explain the name and
parentage of the Grecian Hecate.<a id="FNanchor92" href="#Footnote92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote91" href="#FNanchor91" class="label">[91]</a> Macdonell, <i>Vedic Mythology</i>, p. 69.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote92" href="#FNanchor92" class="label">[92]</a> It is not to be supposed that only the month of the summer
solstice was divided into the three parts, personified by Ekata,
Dvita, and Trita: the legend of Trita Aptya, that is, Trita in the
waters (or, of the waters), is necessarily restricted to that season
in which the moon came to its full in the constellations Aquarius
or Pisces. Some interesting indications in Indian and Greek
mythology seem to point to a similar division of other months,
but the subject is surrounded with uncertainties and difficulties.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>A study of ancient European calendars may, on
the other hand, eke out our knowledge concerning
the astronomic scheme in which Trita and his<span class="pagenum" id="Page180">[180]</span>
brothers played such important parts. We read
that in the Attic year “each month was divided into
three decades,” and the statement may confirm us
in the opinion that, following an almost too mathematically
imagined calendrical method, the ancestors
of the Aryan race in remote ages counted their
months, not as containing twenty-nine-and-a-half
solar days, but as a portion of time containing three
great equal divisions, the first, the second, and the
third—Ekata, Dvita, Trita—each of these three
parts being again subdivided into ten equal tithis.
If this should have been the case, it would be
interesting to note that the Greeks (and the Romans
also, as shown by their cumbrous system of Kalends,
Nones, and Ides) retained the plan of a threefold
division of the months, but lost the originally concomitant
arrangement of the ten equal divisions of
each part into tithis, whence much difficulty ensued
for Greeks and Romans alike in counting lunar
months of alternately thirty and twenty-nine days.
Indian astronomers, on the other hand, who retain
the accurate and elaborate division of the month
into equal tithis, must have long ago lost the thought
of its originally threefold partition, for the Indians<span class="pagenum" id="Page181">[181]</span>
count each month as composed not of three periods
of time, but of <i>a light and a dark half</i>.<a id="FNanchor93" href="#Footnote93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote93" href="#FNanchor93" class="label">[93]</a> “The Luni-Solar year is used for the regulation of festivals
and domestic arrangements; it commences at present at the
instant of conjunction of the Sun and Moon in the Sidereal
month Chaitra. The Hindu Lunar months invariably consist of
thirty Tithis, or Lunar days; and the whole month is divided into
two equal parts of fifteen Tithis each, the one called Shukla or
Shuddh Paksha—the bright half or increase of the Moon; the
other Krishna or Vadya Paksha—the dark half or decrease of the
Moon.” (<i>The Indian Calendar</i> for the year 1892.)</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>To one more lunar Vedic personage let us
direct our attention: namely, to Atri—Atri who,
unlike the conquering and ever-victorious Trita,
is chiefly celebrated for his misfortunes. Agni,
Indra, and especially the Aswins, moved by his
misfortunes, come to the help of Atri, and by
means of a hundred acts, a hundred devices, they
extricate him from captivity, whether from a dark
cavern or from a burning chasm. They make the
time of his captivity even pleasant to him, giving
him refreshing drink.</p>

<p>One of our own poets may help us to understand
the Vedic metaphor of Atri’s darksome cave.

<p>Atri is, I believe, a personification of the <i>New
Moon</i>, and thus we may understand how he is
sometimes described as hidden in a dark cave,
while at other times he is spoken of as in a fiery
chasm, when the uppermost thought in the Vedic
poet’s mind is the close conjunction of the moon
at that time with the burning sun. From his
dark cave, or burning chasm, Atri is delivered
by the “hundred acts” of worship and sacrifice
which it was the custom in India, as in many
other countries, to offer up at the time of New
Moon, especially at the marked festivals of the
winter and summer solstice, or the beginning of
the calendrical year. On one occasion<a id="FNanchor94" href="#Footnote94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>
we hear of<span class="pagenum" id="Page183">[183]</span>
Atri coming to the assistance of the sun, which
had been hidden by the demon Swarbhānu. This
darkening of the sun is generally understood to
refer to a solar eclipse. A solar eclipse can only
take place at the time of new moon. It is a little
puzzling to find Atri, if Atri personifies the new
moon, saving the sun from eclipse instead of
being the cause of the disaster; but as in the Rig
Veda Atri always appears as a friend, not an
enemy, of the gods of light—Agni, Indra, and
the Aswins—we may suppose that the Vedic bard
chose to represent him as being present at, rather
than causing the sun’s eclipse. It may also be
that a certain number of divisions of lunar time
were considered as personified by Atri, and that
an eclipse terminated in the third or fourth of
those divisions; so that it could be said that Atri
“by his fourth sacred prayer” discovered the
sun. The passage is no doubt a difficult one;<span class="pagenum" id="Page184">[184]</span>
still the fact that Atri was present at the eclipse
of the sun seems to tell rather in favour of than
against the supposition that Atri was a personification
of the time of new moon.</p>

THE CHINESE CALENDAR, WITH SOME

<p>The Chinese Lunar Zodiac is divided into 28
star groups named Siou. Gustav Schlegel in his
<i>Uranographie Chinoise</i> having enumerated these 28
siou—or as he translates that term, “domiciles”—says:
“La première chose qui nous frappe en
voyant la liste des 28 domiciles, c’est qu’elle commence
par le domicile <i>Kio</i>, ou la <i>Vierge</i>, preuve
positive que c’était avec ce domicile que l’année a
dû commencer primitivement,”<a id="FNanchor95" href="#Footnote95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> and further on he
quotes from “le <i>Eul-ya</i> cette antique dictionnaire,”
as follows: “<i>L’Ancien des constellations</i>, c’est <i>Kio</i> et<span class="pagenum" id="Page186">[186]</span>
<i>Kang</i> ... ils sont les chefs des domiciles, et à
cause de cela on les nomme <i>l’ancien des constellations</i>:
et ‘le signe d’Ancien des constellations’ est
exactement les domiciles <i>Kio</i> et <i>Kang</i>.”<a id="FNanchor96" href="#Footnote96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> Schlegel
adds: “Ce nom de <i>Ancien des constellations</i> répond
exactement à celui de <i>Princeps Signorum</i> que les
astrologues romains donnerent au <i>bélier</i>; à l’époque
où cette constellation était signe de l’équinoxe du
printemps. C’est-à-dire que le signe qui annonçait
le commencement de l’année était le premier, le
Princeps signorum, l’Ancien, le Chef, des constellations.
Mais ces étoiles de la Vierge portent encore
d’autres noms qui tous out rapport au fait astronomique
que l’astérisme <i>Kio</i> ouvrait l’année. Le
‘Sing-king’ les nomme les <i>Chefs des quatre
régions</i>, les <i>Légions célestes</i>.... <i>Elles président
aux métamorphoses de la création: elles sont traversées
par l’écliptique et les sept clartés (7 planets)
commencent (leur révolution) par elles.</i>”</p>

<p>The concluding words from the Sing-king which
I have marked in italics—giving as they do the
opinions held by ancient <i>Chinese</i> writers respecting
the first divisions of their Lunar Zodiac—may<span class="pagenum" id="Page187">[187]</span>
remind us of the opinions held by <i>Indian</i> astronomers
as to their first division of the Zodiac.</p>

<p>In Whitney’s comments on the <i>Sûrya Siddhânta</i>
he observes:—“The initial point of the fixed Hindu
sphere, from which longitudes are reckoned, <i>and at
which the planetary motions are held by all schools of
Hindu astronomy to have commenced at the creation</i>,
is the end of the asterism Revatî, or the beginning
of Açvinî.”<a id="FNanchor97" href="#Footnote97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>It is impossible to read of these two traditions
concerning the initial point of the Chinese and of
the Hindu ecliptic series of constellations, without
suspecting some underlying cause common to both
traditions.</p>

<p>The Chinese and Hindu initial points are diametrically
opposite to each other on the ecliptic.
Calendrically speaking, such opposite points may be
taken to mark the same season and the same month—as
for instance, in the old Accadian calendar the
month names referred to the stars in <i>conjunction</i>
with the sun. The month of the sacrifice of righteousness
corresponded to the month during which
the sun was in conjunction with the sacrificial Ram.<span class="pagenum" id="Page188">[188]</span>
This same month counted (theoretically) from the
arrival of the sun at the end of Revati and beginning
of Aswinī—the initial point of the Indian Zodiac—is
in India called, after the star group in <i>opposition</i>,
Chaitra.</p>

<p>Spica (α Virginis) is the chief star of the Nakshatra
Chaitra, and Spica also is the chief star of
the Chinese siou Kio, “l’astérisme,” which, according
to the tradition above recorded, “ouvrait l’année,”
and which (together with the neighbouring “siou
Kang), président aux métamorphoses de la création,”
“sont traversées par l’écliptique, et les sept clartés
commencent leur révolution par elles.”</p>

<p>To any interested in the history of the Chinese
calendar, or rather to any interested in the history
of the human race, the question as to the reason for
the choice of this point and for the equal honour in
which it was held (as we have seen) by the Accadian,
the Hindu, and the Chinese nations, is a question
worthy of close attention.</p>

<p>In former Papers contributed to these <i>Proceedings</i>,
I have drawn attention to the many indications
in ancient cuneiform and Indian literature, which
seem to point to the conclusion that about 6,000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page189">[189]</span>
in some part of Asia and in a latitude probably as
far north as 40 degrees, a calendar was instituted by
“some ancient race of men,” that this calendar dealt
with a year beginning at the season of the <i>winter
solstice</i>, and that the stars which at that date were
chosen to mark the solstitial year were those in the
first degrees of the constellation Aries in <i>conjunction</i>
with—and the bright star Spica in <i>opposition</i> to—the
sun. I suggested that the Accadians and later
Babylonians, as also the Aryans of India, continued
to follow as star-marks for their years the constellations
chosen by the institutors of this ancient
calendar, and that therefore in the course of ages
the beginning of the years of these peoples moved
gradually away from the season of the <i>winter
solstice</i>, approaching always nearer to the <i>vernal
equinox</i>, close to which point we find it “bound”
at the time of the fall of the Babylonian power;
while in India, where the star-mark Spica is still
followed, the year now begins about twenty days
after the spring equinox.</p>

<p>Indications in Mesopotamian and Indian literature
have seemed to me to point to the above conclusions.
The opposed view, held by most writers<span class="pagenum" id="Page190">[190]</span>
on the subject, is that only at the late date (about
the beginning of our era) when the stars of Aries in
conjunction, and the star of Spica in opposition,
marked the <i>equinoctial</i> season, were they adopted as
marks for the beginning of the year by Babylonians
and Hindus respectively.</p>

<p>I think that the position held by the star Spica
in Chinese ancient astronomical tradition may be
claimed as telling strongly in favour of an originally
<i>solstitial</i> as opposed to an originally <i>equinoctial</i>
beginning of the sidereal years of the Accadian,
Hindu, and Chinese nations, for never has the claim
been made that the <i>Chinese</i> years were counted from
the vernal equinox; but on the contrary the opinion
has been very generally held and expressed by
Chinese scholars that at some remote date the new
year’s festival was held in China at the season of
the winter solstice.</p>

<p>Gustav Schlegel, one of the latest writers on the
subject of Chinese astronomy, though he admits
that, “selon l’opinion générale l’année chinoise
commence toujours avec le solstice d’hiver,” has
put forward a view entirely opposed to this generally
held opinion: according to his theory, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page191">[191]</span>
Chinese have from the most remote times counted
their years, as they count them at present—<i>i.e.</i>,
from the new moon nearest to <i>the season mid-way
between the winter solstice and the spring equinox</i>:
and as he is convinced—as we have seen—that the
beginning of the Chinese year was originally marked
by the asterism Kio, he demands as the lowest
possible date for this origin of the Chinese calendar,
that of 16,916 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>, when the constellation Kio
marked, by its heliacal rising, the mid-season between
solstice and equinox.</p>

<p>Schlegel brings forward many learned and ingenious
arguments drawn from Chinese literature to
support this theory. It would be impossible at
second hand, and in a small space, to state fairly his
arguments with a view to rebutting them. His
volumes are full of valuable information concerning
the “Uranographie Chinoise,” but it has not seemed
to me when reading and re-reading his work, that
the grounds on which he relies are sufficiently
established to support the high claims to antiquity
which he puts forward for the origin of the modern
Chinese method of counting the year from the mid-season
between solstice and equinox.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page192">[192]</span></p>

<p>It has on the contrary seemed to me that on
historical grounds a theory may be arrived at which
will furnish a reasonable explanation of the present
somewhat exceptional Chinese calendrical methods,
and which will, if it is accepted, strongly reinforce
the grounds for holding the already general opinion
that the year in ancient times in China was solstitial.
That opinion once established must lead us with
increased confidence to attribute the honour traditionally
paid by Hindus and Chinese alike to the
initial point of their respective ecliptic series of star
groups to, as I have said, their common acquaintance
with a calendar established on high authority
at the date in round numbers of 6,000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span></p>

<p>The year in China is luni-solar, and it is, as has
been pointed out, counted from the season exactly
midway between the winter solstice and the spring
equinox.</p>

<p>It is counted from this mid-season and not from
the sun’s opposition to, or conjunction with, any
particular star or star group. It is therefore not
a <i>sidereal</i> but a <i>tropical</i> year; and it is estimated
at exactly the same length as is our European
Gregorian year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page193">[193]</span></p>

<p>We here in Europe are not yet tired of congratulating
ourselves on the scientific success attained
by Pope Gregory XIII., when in 1582 he,
with the help of many learned men and astronomers,
established, as a reform of the earlier Julian
calendar, a method of securely binding all recurring
anniversaries—civil and ecclesiastical—to the exact
same <i>season</i> of the year.</p>

<p>Calculations for the arrangement of the Julian
calendar had strained the scientific powers of the
astronomers of Greece and Rome in Cæsar’s time,
but the length of the year estimated by them was
twelve minutes greater than that arrived at by the
astronomers of Gregory’s later date.</p>

<p>To find, as we do, in the far east of Asia a
people counting the length of their luni-solar year
with the same accurate exactness as that only
attained to as late as 1582 <span class="smcapall">A.D.</span> in Europe, might
well cause us surprise, were it not that history
furnishes us with an easy explanation of this exact
identity of Chinese and European calendrical calculations,
by teaching us that the calendar by which
the Chinese now count their years, and by which
they have counted them for nearly three hundred<span class="pagenum" id="Page194">[194]</span>
years, was really compiled at Peking by Roman
ecclesiastics, to whom the Gregorian methods were
well known, and for whom, indeed, the study of
these methods must have possessed the charm of
novelty added to its intrinsic utility and scientific
interest.</p>

<p>Two learned Jesuit Fathers obtained in the
17th century great influence at the Chinese Court.
In 1600 <span class="smcapall">A.D.</span>, Matteo Ricci was allowed with his
companions to settle at Peking, where he spent the
remainder of his life in teaching mathematics and
other sciences.</p>

<p>In 1610, Johann Adam von Schall, another
learned Jesuit Father, “was sent out partly in
consequence of his knowledge of mathematics and
astronomy to China,” and was ultimately “invited
to the Imperial Court at Peking, where <i>he was
entrusted with the reformation of the calendar</i>
and the direction of the public mathematical
school.”<a id="FNanchor98" href="#Footnote98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>Under these circumstances, when we read that
“according to the Chinese work, <i>Wan-nian-shu</i>, or
‘Ten thousand-year Calendar,’ in which the elements<span class="pagenum" id="Page195">[195]</span>
of the Chinese calendar from 1624 <span class="smcapall">A.D.</span> until
1921 <span class="smcapall">A.D.</span> are calculated by the Astronomical Board at
Peking, the earliest date of the Chinese New Year’s
Day is January 21st, and the latest February 20th”<a id="FNanchor99" href="#Footnote99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>—when
we read this and remember that Johann
Adam von Schall was in 1624 in charge of the
reformation of the calendar at Peking, we need feel
no surprise to find “the elements of the Chinese
calendar” calculated in advance for 279 tropical,
that is Gregorian, years. Indeed the influence of
the European ecclesiastic in these calculations is
clearly to be recognized in their very form, for we
are easily reminded by it of the “Table to find
Easter from the present time to—such and such a
year—<span class="smcapall">A.D.</span> inclusive,” prefixed to our English Books
of Common Prayer. And we may be tempted to
smile when we see the jealously conservative
Chinese nation so peaceably—perhaps unwittingly—accepting
a reformation of their calendar at the
hands of foreigners, and contrast with this acceptance
the turbulent opposition with which for so<span class="pagenum" id="Page196">[196]</span>
long the introduction of the Gregorian calendar
into many European countries was resisted.</p>

<p>It may well be that the Jesuit Fathers to whom
the Emperor entrusted the reformation of the
calendar were themselves not aware of the magnitude
of the reformation they were introducing into
Chinese methods, for they found the luni-solar
festival of the new year, as we may learn from the
Chinese literature of that date, occurring close to
that <i>season</i> to which they then so scientifically bound
it. But, according to the theory which in this Paper
I am anxious to advocate, this <i>season</i> midway between
solstice and equinox had not been chosen
with definite intention as the first of the year by the
Chinese, but had only been arrived at, in consequence
of an age-long following on their part of
a star group, chosen thousands of years earlier, by
one of their ancient emperors, as that from which the
beginning of their year was to be counted. This star
group was the Siou (domicile) Hiu, the eleventh division
of their Lunar Zodiac, and it is marked by the
stars β Aquarii and α Equulei. (See
<a href="#PlateXIV">diagram</a>.)<a id="FNanchor100" href="#Footnote100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote100" href="#FNanchor100" class="label">[100]</a> The 28 Siou are not of equal extent, and there are many
discrepancies in the Chinese tables which profess to give the
number of degrees attributed to each. In the diagram, therefore,
only the stars which compose the three adjoining domiciles, Niu,
Hiu, and Wei are noted, and they are connected by straight lines,
according to Chinese astronomical custom.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page197">[197]</span></p>

<p>There is in the great History of China a
description given of a reformation of the calendar
carried out by the Emperor Tchuen-Hio, whose
date is placed at 2510-2431 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span> The conjunction
of the sun and moon close to the Siou Hiu is in this
description clearly referred to as a mark given for
the beginning of the year. But the fact of this
choice of the star mark Hiu has, for European
scholars, been obscured by a most unfortunate
paraphrase made use of by Père de Mailla, the
translator into French of the <i>Histoire Générale de
la Chine</i>. He gives us in the passage describing
Tchuen-Hio’s reformation the phrase, “15° du
Verseau,” instead of the Chinese expression, “the
Siou Hiu.”<a id="FNanchor101" href="#Footnote101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote101" href="#FNanchor101" class="label">[101]</a> The fact that P. de Mailla has so paraphrased the Chinese
original has thus plainly been attested by the late Professor
Legge. In answer to a question addressed to him on the subject,
he wrote, in December 1894, to Mr. H. W. Greene, Fellow of
Magdalen College, Oxford, as follows: “In the passage from
P. de Mailla’s History, that writer is both translating and paraphrasing
‘the star group Hiu.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page199">[199]</span></p>

<p>The Siou Hiu extends over some eight or ten
degrees of the ecliptic in the constellation Aquarius;
to restrict to <i>one</i> degree the given star mark was an
inaccuracy serious enough in an astronomical statement,
but this inaccuracy is as nothing when compared
with the further entire distortion of facts
occasioned by P. de Mailla’s use of the ambiguous
phrase, “15° du Verseau,” ambiguous because it can
be taken to refer either to the fifteenth degree of
the <i>sign</i>, or of the <i>constellation</i> “du Verseau”
(Aquarius).</p>

<p>The Siou Hiu is situated, as stated above, in
the <i>constellation</i> Aquarius (see <a href="#PlateXIV">diagram</a>), but astronomers
reading P. de Mailla’s translation have
understood the phrase in its technical sense, and
have therefore been led to believe that the Emperor
Tchuen-Hio fixed the beginning of the
Chinese year to the 15° of the <i>sign</i> Aquarius;
and as, astronomically and technically speaking,
the 15° Aquarius (sign) has no reference to any
star or constellation, but is only that point of
the ecliptic to which the sun attains exactly at the
mid-season between winter solstice and spring
equinox, they have taken for granted that 2,500 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>
the Chinese year began at that point, and therefore<span class="pagenum" id="Page200">[200]</span>
at the same season as it does at the present
time.</p>

<p>But as we now learn on the high authority of
Professor Legge that it was to the <i>star group Hiu</i>
that Tchuen-Hio is recorded to have bound the
beginning of the year, we know that if the record
is true, the year in Tchuen-Hio’s time must have
begun at the <i>winter solstice</i>, and not at the <i>mid-season</i>,
between it and the equinox.</p>

<p>When due correction of P. de Mailla’s paraphrase
has been made in the passage recording Tchuen-Hio’s
reform, there remains still a difficulty to be
overcome in the account of this event given in the
<i>Histoire Générale de la Chine</i>, or rather I should
say that it is when we have corrected P. de Mailla’s
paraphrase that this difficulty appears. For in the
history it is stated that it was from the new moon at
the beginning of spring, and near to the star group
Hiu, that the year was then and henceforth to be
counted, and this statement contains an astronomical
contradiction. Our knowledge of the precession of
the equinoxes teaches us that the star group Hiu in
Tchuen-Hio’s time did not mark the <i>beginning of
spring</i>, but rather the very <i>middle of winter</i>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page201">[201]</span>
Unless, then, we throw aside as worthless the whole
record of Tchuen-Hio’s reform of the calendar, we
are driven to suppose that some Chinese historian,
ignorant of the precession of the equinoxes, and
writing at a date when, owing to that precession,
the first new moon of spring was indeed close to
the star group Hiu, and that of the winter solstice
far distant from it—that this historian made what
he may well have considered a necessary correction
in the record with which he was dealing, and
substituted the “first day of spring” for the
“mid-winter season.” Nor need we much blame
him for making such a correction, when we
find ourselves driven by stress of modern enlightenment
to correct his correction, and to read
“mid-winter” where he has written “beginning of
spring.”</p>

<p>Let us now read with due corrections, between
square brackets, the record of Tchuen-Hio’s reformation
of the calendar as given in the <i>Histoire Générale
de la Chine</i>.</p>

<p>It may, of course, be objected to the proposed
correction of the <i>season</i> in this passage as follows:
granting that either the star mark Hiu, or the <i>spring
season</i> said to have been chosen by Tchuen-Hio,
must have been erroneously recorded in the <i>Histoire
Générale</i>, the probabilities are equal as to which
element in the statement is or is not true. Tchuen-Hio
may have chosen the moon nearest to the first
day of spring, and may have named some constellation
other than Hiu near to which this first moon
was in conjunction with the sun. The late Chinese
historian, instead of tampering as above supposed
with the recorded <i>season</i>, may have substituted the
name of the star group Hiu, which at his date
marked the beginning of spring, for that “other”
chosen by Tchuen-Hio.</p>

<p>But the probabilities on this point are in reality
not equally balanced. For, in the first instance, we
must take into consideration the very general opinion
that the year in China anciently began at the winter
solstice, and the fact that this season was in Tchuen-Hio’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page204">[204]</span>
time so accurately marked by the junction of
the star groups Wei and Hiu (see <a href="#PlateXIV">diagram</a>), and
we must further take into consideration the many
references to the star group Hiu in ancient
Chinese literature, which connect it very specially
with traditions concerning the Emperor Tchuen-Hio.
Many passages in the works of the Père
Gaubil are to be met with to this effect, as for
instance where he thus quotes and comments
on a statement in the Eul-ya. “On désigne
<i>Hiuen-hiao</i> par la Constellation Hui (<i>sic</i>); on
appelle encore ce Signe <i>Tchouen-Hio</i>.” Gaubil
adds, “Le Signe Hiuen-Hiao est celui que nous
appelons Amphora. Le dictionnaire [Eul-ya] met
dans ce Signe la Constellation <i>Hiu</i>; c’est-à-dire que
le Signe commençoit par quelque degré de cette
Constellation. L’Histoire Chinoise asseure que
l’eau est le symbole du régne de Tchouen-Hiu (<i>sic</i>).
L’Eul-ya dit formellement que Hiuen-hiao Signe
Celeste du Zodiaque désigne l’Empereur <i>Tchouen-Hiu</i>
(<i>sic</i>).”<a id="FNanchor103" href="#Footnote103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>
Schlegel also tells us that the Chinese placed
the soul of Tchuen-Hio in the constellation Hiu.</p>

<p>But not only is Hiu in Chinese literature closely
associated with the Emperor Tchuen-Hio: it is also
closely bracketed with the season of the winter solstice.
Schlegel gives many quotations to this effect
from Chinese authorities, but he would refer all such
allusions to the far back time between 14,000 and
13,000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>, when Hiu was in opposition to the sun
at that season, not in conjunction with it as at
Tchuen-Hio’s date.</p>

<p>Of Hiu he writes:—</p>

<p>Taking these various passages into consideration,
we are, I think, led to feel that the probabilities in
favour of Tchuen-Hio having chosen the star group
Hiu to mark, in conjunction with the sun, the winter
solstice, are greater than those in favour of a comparatively
modern choice of that star group as a
mark for the beginning of spring.</p>

<p>Reading the passage of the <i>Histoire Générale</i> as
corrected above, we may assume that Tchuen-Hio
intended to establish sure rules by which the Chinese
were for the future to count their years from the
<i>solstice</i>, and from the conjunction of sun and moon
close to the star group Hiu. But we also know that
the following of these sure rules was an impossibility.
Either the season or the star mark must in the long
course of ages have been abandoned. It would
be a difficult, perhaps an impossible, task to ascertain
how far, or in what manner, the attempt was
made under successive dynasties to carry out the
injunctions of Tchuen-Hio. We read in the <i>Confucian
Analects</i> that in answer to his “disciple,”
who had asked him, “how the government of a
country should be administered,” the Master said—as
the first of five rules—“Follow the seasons of<span class="pagenum" id="Page207">[207]</span>
Hsiâ.” And in his note on this text the commentator
says, “Confucius approved the rule of the Hsiâ
dynasty. His decision has been the law of all the
dynasties since the Ch’in.”<a id="FNanchor106" href="#Footnote106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> During all the centuries
in which the Hea or Hsiâ dynasty held
sway, <i>i.e.</i>, from 2205 to 1766 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>, the sure rules
of Tchuen-Hio might have been carried out without
much difficulty, for at the <i>new moon nearest to
the winter solstice</i> the sun would still have been in or
<i>near to the constellation Hiu</i> (see diagram), though
at the date of Confucius, 551-479 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>, this was no
longer the case. Judging from the final result,
we may, I think, take it for granted that the
Chinese followed the <i>star mark</i> and not the <i>season</i>
appointed for the beginning of the year by Tchuen-Hio.
And thus following the star mark, the beginning
of their year imperceptibly receded from the
solstice, and approached the spring equinox, so that
in 1600 <span class="smcapall">A.D.</span> the Jesuit fathers found the year still
beginning at the new moon, “vers le Siou Hiu,”
<i>and hence at the season midway between the winter
solstice and the spring equinox.</i></p>

<p>In a former Paper contributed to these
<i>Proceedings</i>,<a id="FNanchor107" href="#Footnote107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>
I suggested that in the inscription engraved
on Gudea’s diorite statue we had evidence of a
reform of the already existing Accadian calendar—in
use from a date much earlier than Gudea’s in the
neighbouring Babylonian kingdom.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p>Gudea’s date is placed by scholars at about 2800
<span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>—not much earlier than at that claimed in the
Chinese History for Tchuen-Hio.</p>

<p>Much honour is given by this priestly ruler of
Lagash “to Ningirsu, and to the goddess Bau, his
beloved consort,” and the concluding lines of the
inscription run as follows:—</p>

<p>“On the day of the beginning of the year, the
day of the festival of Bau, on which offerings were
made: one calf, one fat sheep, three lambs, six full
grown sheep, two rams, seven <i>pat</i> of dates, seven
<i>sab</i> of cream, seven palm buds.</p>

<p>“Such were the offerings made to the goddess
Bau, in the ancient temple on that day.”</p>

<p>The generally received opinion as to Ningirsu
(Ninib) is, that he was the god of the “southern
sun”; and, as I contended in my Paper, the <i>southern<span class="pagenum" id="Page209">[209]</span>
sun</i>, if we think of the sun in its <i>yearly</i>, not merely
in its daily course, may fitly represent the sun of the
winter solstice, while the goddess Bau = Gula is the
goddess by whose very name the constellation
Aquarius, as we may assume, was designated in the
Accadian astrological texts.</p>

<p>If from Gudea’s inscription concerning the new
year’s festival a reform in the calendar of Lagash
may be inferred, by which the beginning of the year
was transferred from the stars of Aries to those of
Aquarius, we should find that the Lagash inscription,
and the great History of China, tell us the
same story—the Lagash inscription supplementing
the Chinese History in this important point—that
whereas the account of Tchuen-Hio’s reform has
been manifestly more or less garbled in its long
descent through human hands: that of Gudea’s new
year’s festival is a contemporaneous and utterly
untampered-with account. It is also of some
moment to note one curious point of resemblance in
the idea connected with the stars of Aquarius, by
the astronomers of countries so far distant from each
other as China and Mesopotamia. Hiu, as we have
learnt, may be translated as “Vacuum,” and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page210">[210]</span>
name of the goddess Bau or Bahu bears the same
signification as the Hebrew word translated in
Genesis i. 2 by “void.”<a id="FNanchor108" href="#Footnote108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p>If we now accept Tchuen-Hio’s reformation as a
re-adjustment of a previously-existing sidereal and
originally solstitial calendar, we are at once given
the clue to the two so similar Hindu and Chinese
traditions quoted above, concerning the initial point
of their Lunar Zodiacs: and we shall recognise that
Kio—containing the star Spica—<i>in opposition to</i>,
and the first degrees of Aswinī, <i>in conjunction with</i>,
the sun, obtained the posts of leaders of the lunar
series for the same reason—namely, <i>that they marked
the beginning of the year at the winter solstice</i> 6000
<span class="smcapall">B.C.</span></p>

<p>To this same cause I have here, and elsewhere,
attributed the fact that in the Accadian calendar the
stars of Aries held the same position, and marked
the <i>first</i> month of the year, as the month of the
“sacrifice of righteousness.”</p>

<p>In thus tracing back the history of the calendars
of the ancient nations of the East, in observing the<span class="pagenum" id="Page211">[211]</span>
identity of their earliest astronomical traditions, and
noting the curious points of contact and divergence
in their later scientific and mythological ideas, the
impression seems to force itself upon us more and
more definitely, that before the races of mankind
were “scattered abroad upon the face of the whole
earth,” their ancestors were capable of great scientific
achievements, and possessed in common high intellectual
aspirations.</p>

<p>We in these later days, so picturing to ourselves
the past, may be freshly struck by the words of the
ancient history, which tell us of the time when “the
whole earth was of one language and of one
speech.”</p>

<p>In the foregoing pages arguments have been urged in support
of the view that the ecliptic circle, at the remote date
(speaking in round numbers) of 6000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>, had been portioned
by some “ancient race of men” into twelve divisions; and
that the twelve constellational figures of the Zodiac had then
also been imagined under forms more or less closely resembling
those which we recognize in the heavens at the present day.</p>

<p>Most of the arguments in favour of this opinion are necessarily
based on considerations connected with the phenomena of
the heavens, effected in the long course of ages by a slow revolution
of the earth’s axis. Astronomers during the last two
thousand years have carefully observed the effects and studied
the causes of this slow terrestrial movement, and they can now
tell us with confidence and exactness that the space of 25,868
years is required for the accomplishment of one such revolution
of the earth’s axis.</p>

<p>In our enquiry into the astronomy of the ancients we need
not at all turn our minds to the difficult subject of the causes, or
indeed even to the fact, of this slow movement of the earth’s
axis, further than to realize fully that its effects have been to produce
a slow but continuous change in the apparent position of the
fixed stars, a change not in their position relatively to each other,
but in their distances from the heavenly equator and its poles.</p>

<p>The effort to fully realize these effects by means of careful
calculations and measurements must prove to any but an
astronomer a most arduous task; but, by aid of the mechanical
contrivance called a “precessional globe,” much of the difficulty<span class="pagenum" id="Page216">[216]</span>
of the task may be overcome. The accompanying diagrams
have been drawn from a precessional globe, which can be
adjusted so as to show the position of the poles and equator
amongst the fixed stars, at dates distant from each other by
intervals of 538 years.<a id="FNanchor109" href="#Footnote109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote109" href="#FNanchor109" class="label">[109]</a>
1800 <span class="smcapall">A.D.</span> is the date to which the globe in question originally refers; the
intervals of 538 years can be reckoned backwards or forwards from this date.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>I have shown in continuous outline those constellations for
whose first imagining it seemed to me as early a date might be
claimed as that referred to in each diagram; all others are given
in dotted outline. The strange figures of the “ancient constellations”
are here drawn as they are represented on the globe; but
the fixed stars which mark these figures for observers of the
heavens, I have not ventured to indicate, as to do so would
have required great accuracy of drawing and measurement.
It is not for a moment to be contended that all the ancient
constellations were imagined <i>exactly</i> under the forms by which
we have learnt to know them from classic representations, from
the poem of Aratos, and from the star list of Ptolemy. Variants
of many of the figures are to be met with in astronomical
atlases and on the celestial globes in use to-day; and to establish
the relative claims concerning the antiquity of these variant
forms is a branch to itself of research.</p>

<p>That these constellations have indeed been well denominated
“ancient” is scarcely to be denied, and our only wonder, when
studying the subject, must be, not that some differences are to be
met with as to the exact form under which, at different dates and
by different nations, these figures were delineated in the heavens,
but rather the wonder must be that (as archæological research
is always more and more clearly establishing) through many
thousands of years, and by nations long and widely separated,
the stars, which to an unaccustomed observer seem to be
scattered in wild and random profusion on the sky, should have<span class="pagenum" id="Page217">[217]</span>
been divided into the same distinct groups, and thought of as
representing the same mysterious beings.</p>

<p>But though it may be impossible to maintain that the Grecians
have handed down to us in an absolutely unchanged form the
figures of the ancient constellations as they were first imagined
in remote ages, yet many proofs may be cited in favour of the
opinion, that not lightly or arbitrarily did astronomical artists
venture to tamper with the Zodiacal and extra-Zodiacal figures.</p>

<p>Some of these proofs have already been pointed out in the
foregoing Papers. Attention will be drawn to others in the consideration
of the diagrams here given.</p>

<p>In Plates <a href="#PlateXV">XV.</a>, <a href="#PlateXVI">XVI.</a>, <a href="#PlateXVII">XVII.</a>,
and <a href="#PlateXVIII">XVIII.</a>, the positions of the
solstitial and equinoctial colures amongst the constellations are
given at the date 5744 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span> Had it been possible, I should have
liked to have drawn these diagrams as at 6000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>—not only
because it is easier to deal with and to remember a round number
such as that, but also because at that date the solstitial colure
passed through the ecliptic only one degree distant from the initial
point of the Indian Zodiac—a point which there seems good
reason to believe was the initial point of many, other than Indian,
ancient Zodiacs.</p>

<p>Owing to the mechanical restrictions of the precessional globe,
it was not possible to adjust it to any more accurate date than
that of 5744 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span></p>

<p>It will not be necessary here to reiterate the considerations
in favour of the opinion already advanced that the calendrical
importance of the constellation Aries in some nations, and its
symbolical importance in the mythology of others, may best be
explained by the supposition that the choice of this constellation
as “Prince and Leader” of the signs was made <i>not</i> when its stars
marked the spring equinox, but when they marked the winter
solstice.</p>

<p>Let us rather take this opinion as a working hypothesis, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page218">[218]</span>
turn our attention to the importance, in ancient symbolism, of
the <i>four</i> constellations—Aries, Cancer, Libra, and Capricornus—which,
according to this hypothesis, marked the <i>four</i> seasons, and
the cardinal points 6000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span></p>

<p>Next in this order to Aries comes Cancer, <i>The Crab</i> (see
<a href="#PlateXVI">Plate XVI.</a>). In Babylonia, it seems to be established that a
<i>tortoise</i>, not a crab, represented the fourth constellation of the
Zodiac. In Egypt, as we learn from the Zodiacs of Esneh and
Denderah, it was the <i>scarabæus</i> beetle that held the place given
to the crab in the Grecian sphere.</p>

<p>There is a sort of outward resemblance between these three
creatures, wide apart as they are anatomically from each other.
They are all hard-shelled, creeping, and insignificant-looking
animals. Why under any of these three forms a constellation of
the Zodiac should have been depicted, it is difficult to conjecture;
but if we have to admit that in Egyptian astronomy the beetle
played the important part of marking as a constellation one of the
quarters of the ecliptic circle, this admission will furnish us with
an adequate reason for the extraordinary honour paid in Egyptian
symbolic art to this lowly, and in itself unattractive, insect.</p>

<p>The scarabæus, according to our hypothesis, marked in ancient
calendrical tradition the spring equinox when in <i>conjunction</i> with
the sun, and the autumn equinox in <i>opposition</i> to it. And it was
as presiding <i>visibly in opposition</i> that we may reasonably suppose
it gained such honour in Egypt. For the autumn, not the spring,
is in that land the time when vegetation begins to burst into life,
and when all Egypt rejoices. I think, moreover, that facts connected
with the worship of the Apis Bull will further strengthen
the opinion that the Egyptians considered the constellations in
<i>opposition</i> to the sun to be those which presided over particular
seasons and months.<a id="FNanchor110" href="#Footnote110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>To trace allusions in the symbolic art of Egypt to Libra—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page219">[219]</span>
third in order of the constellations we are now discussing (see
<a href="#PlateXVII">Plate XVII.</a>)—is, it must be confessed, not so simple a matter,
and it is with some diffidence that I put forward the following
suggestion—<i>i.e.</i>, that we may perhaps find in the “two feathers,”
so prominent in Egyptian mythologic imagery, a reference to the
two scales of the Balance (Libra).</p>

<div class="figright w15emmax">

<img src="images/illo261.jpg" alt="">

<p class="caption">The Didû dressed.</p>

</div><!--figright-->

<p>In allegorical language <i>we</i> speak often of
the even scales of Justice, and in art the goddess
is always represented with the Balance
in her hand. In Egyptian symbolism and
art, I think the two feathers represented the
equal weights of the scales of Justice. In
the great judgment hall of Osiris, the souls
of men were weighed in the balance. The
soul, or heart, of the dead Egyptian was
placed in one scale, while a feather—or the
figure of the goddess Mait, wearing on her
head a single plume or feather—occupied
the other. Mait was the goddess of Justice,
and we often read also of “the two Maits
who preside over Justice and Truth.”</p>

<p>There is a woodcut in Prof. Maspero’s
<i>Dawn of Civilization</i>, p. 130, in which
the head-dress—the symbolic head-dress—so
often to be met with in Egyptian mythologic
representations, is very clearly drawn.
It was in studying this woodcut that the idea
first suggested itself to my mind, that in this head-dress we may
find a reference to the four constellations which, when the
Zodiac was first imagined, marked the four colures—the four
quarters of the heavens—that it was in fact an astronomic
monogram, combining four figures in one.</p>

<p>In this head-dress very plainly are to be seen the horns of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page220">[220]</span>
ram, and those of a goat. Less convincingly, perhaps, the disc
from which spring the goat’s horns suggests “the disc enclosing
a scarabæus,”<a id="FNanchor111" href="#Footnote111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> under which form the sun as <i>Khophri</i>—“He who
is”<a id="FNanchor112" href="#Footnote112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>—was sometimes represented by the Egyptians.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote112" href="#FNanchor112" class="label">[112]</a> <i>Ibid.</i> p. 138.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>The two feathers in outline clearly show themselves, but to
connect these two feathers with the scales of Libra is only adventured
as a possible means of giving an astronomic value to the so
often repeated combination of the forms in this head-dress.</p>

<p>As to Capricornus (the fourth of the constellations which
marked the colures 6000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>), (see <a href="#PlateXVIII">Plate XVIII.</a>), we do not
meet with any representations, so far as I know, of a goat-fish
on Egyptian monuments, but on Babylonian boundary stones and
engraved gems this monster is often to be seen, exactly represented
in form and attitude as on the Grecian sphere. The goat’s
<i>horns</i> are all we find portrayed in ancient Egyptian art, and when
they are portrayed they appear together with the <i>ram’s horns</i>, and
often springing out of a ram’s head. For this curt reference to the
goat (Capricornus) a reason may be found by remembering that
this constellation, <i>in opposition</i>, presided—traditionally—over the
least honoured season of the Egyptian year—the arid season
preceding the inundations.</p>

<p>It should be borne in mind that all the Egyptian mythologic
symbolism we have been considering must necessarily have only
embodied traditions already even under the earliest dynasties
extremely ancient; for it was, as may be seen in the Plates, about
6000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span> that the colures touched the extreme western degrees of
the constellations Aries, Cancer, and Libra—and a point some
degrees to the west of Capricornus, as it is now drawn. In each
succeeding century the colures moved still more to the west,
through the stars, and from 6000 down to 4000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span> they were no
longer to be observed in the four already named constellations,
but in Pisces, Gemini, Virgo, and Sagittarius.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page221">[221]</span></p>

<p>It is curious to note that there seems to be no pronounced
allusion in Egyptian art or literature to these four constellations,
though there are indications (see pp. 230-238) which may lead us
to believe that the astronomical phenomena of the later date, 4000
<span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>, were closely observed, and seem to have formed the basis of
much of the mythology of Egypt.</p>

<p>These facts tend to confirm the conclusion—so often advocated
in this book—that the ancestors of the Egyptians, as also of
all the great civilized nations of antiquity, followed through many
long ages the same sidereal calendar—one based on the observation
of the colures amongst the fixed stars 6000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span> And it
would seem that not till about 4000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>, when the colures had
traversed, from east to west, the constellations Pisces, Gemini,
Virgo, and Sagittarius, and had arrived at the eastern degrees of
Aquarius, Taurus, Leo, and Scorpio, did astronomic authorities in
Egypt direct their attention to a reform of the calendar and introduce
into it, and into religious observances, references to these
four last-named constellations.</p>

<p>Turning to <a href="#PlateXVI">Plate XVI.</a> we may notice that the equinoctial
colure, marking out as it does the extreme western limits of the
constellation Cancer, passes also through a part of the constellation
Gemini. This fact may, I think, help to explain some of the
legends connected with the twins Castor and Pollux in ancient
lore.</p>

<p>A very brilliant star glitters on the head of each twin. These
stars are of almost equal lustre and well deserve the name of twin
stars; and so we can easily suppose how it was that the imaginative
astronomers who, at the early date in question, mapped out
the figures of the Zodiac, noticing that the equinoctial colure
passed between these two bright stars, should have elected to
represent them as marking the heads of twin figures, which they
determined should symbolize the <i>equal day and night</i> of the
season over which they presided.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page222">[222]</span></p>

<p>These two stars, thousands of years after they had ceased to
mark the equinox, were still associated by the Greeks with the
twin heroes—Castor and Pollux—brothers who, according to the
legend, were “possessed of an immortality of existence so divided
among them, that as one dies, the other revives.” The learned
Dr Barrett has pointed out that “this furnishes a complete description
of Day and Night.” This remark of Dr Barrett’s becomes
especially interesting if we attribute the first symbolizing of day and
night by these stars to the work of astronomers at a date when
the day and night these stars symbolized were of exactly equal
length, and when, therefore, the equal stars and equal alternation
of light and darkness might both be fitly symbolized as twins.</p>

<p>At <a href="#PlateXVIII">Plate XVIII.</a> it is to be observed that the equinoctial
colure, instead of adjoining Capricornus, occupies an almost
central position in the preceding constellation, Sagittarius. This
fact, together with other considerations, has led me to think that
originally only the bow and arrow of Sagittarius were imagined for
that division of the ecliptic; and that the huge composite figure of
the archer—half man and half horse—was added to the original
design in later ages, by astronomers who chose the spring equinox
instead of the winter solstice for the beginning of the year.</p>

<p>In discussing the Median calendar, the importance which
seems to have been given by the ancestors of the Medes to the
constellation Sagittarius, at a date when it marked the spring
equinox, was dwelt upon. It will, I think, appear likely, when we
come to study <a href="#PlateXIX">Plates XIX.</a> and
<a href="#PlateXX">XX.</a>, that as early as 4600 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>
constellations were imagined to honour and mark the equinoctial
as well as the solstitial seasons.</p>

<p>Perhaps then, at that date the constellation Sagittarius was
extended to its present dimensions; and it may be that some
centuries later, when the colure of the <i>winter solstice</i> had passed
into the constellation Aquarius, some astronomers desired—like
Gudea of Lagash and Tchuen-Hio in China—to honour that<span class="pagenum" id="Page223">[223]</span>
season, and to make it the beginning of the year. It may be that
such astronomers dealt with the eleventh constellation of the
Zodiac, as earlier ones had dealt with Sagittarius, and that they
added to what was possibly originally only a <i>water jar</i>, Amphora,
the figure of the <i>water pourer</i> Aquarius.</p>

<p>These ideas are put forward very speculatively. They were
partly suggested by noticing that in the Indian Zodiac the name of
the constellation Sagittarius is merely Dhanus (arrow), and the
name of Aquarius is Kumbha (water jar).</p>

<p>In the diagrams which we have been discussing, it will be
observed that only the twelve figures of the Zodiac, and <i>two</i> of the
extra-Zodiacal constellations, are given in continuous outline, one
of these two is Draco—the dragon or serpent whose folds surround
the <i>Pole of the Ecliptic</i>—the central point of the circle of the
Zodiac.</p>

<p>That the astronomers who traced out the circle of the Zodiac
on the heavens, and imagined its twelve strange figures, should
also have devoted attention to, and marked out, its central point,
is not improbable. The <i>Pole of the Ecliptic</i>, unlike the <i>Pole of
the Heavens</i>, is immoveable amongst the fixed stars. At 6000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>,
as at the present date, the stars of Draco surrounded this point—a
point not itself marked by any conspicuous star. We have not,
however, I think, at present sufficient grounds for deciding at what
exact date the constellation Draco was imagined under the form
it now holds. But that it is very ancient there is no doubt.</p>

<p>For the first depicting on the vault of heaven of the figure of
Bootes, I claim with much stronger conviction the date of 6000
<span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>, and the latitude of 45° north. For then and there Bootes
might be seen at midnight of the summer solstice, standing upright
on the northern horizon, his head reaching nearly to the
Pole of the Heavens. Never since that date has he held so commanding
a position in the sky, nor at any more southern latitude
could his whole figure have been represented as standing on the
horizon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page224">[224]</span></p>

<p>One further suggestion as to this constellation I am tempted
to make. Not, it is true, on the same firm astronomical grounds
as those put forward for the date of the first imagining of the
figure, but a suggestion based on the Greek name of the constellation.</p>

<p>The name Bootes has been translated as ox-driver, and of
him Aratos says:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse indent00">“The <i>Bear-ward</i>, whom mankind the <i>Ploughman</i> call,</div>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>The seven bright stars which mark the tail and part of the
body of the Great Bear are often spoken of as “the Plough,” and
in the large remaining space allotted on the sphere to the constellation
Ursa Major, it would not be difficult to include oxen
harnessed to the brightly marked celestial plough.</p>

<p>I have said that at midnight of the summer solstice the constellation
Bootes—if we suppose it to have been imagined at
6000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>—presided visibly over the northern sky. But we have
learnt from the month names in the Accadian calendar that the
astronomers who instituted it always directed attention to the
constellations which <i>invisibly</i> accompanied the sun in his daily
journeyings from east to west, rather than to those which (in opposition)
were visible through the hours of the night. For example—all
through the mid-winter month of the sacrifice of righteousness,
the stars of the Ram—the celestial symbol of that sacrifice—were
invisible, hidden in the overpowering light of the sun. In like
manner, I think, we may assume that at the close of the Accadian
year—in the “month of the sowing of seed” or in “the dark
month of sowing,” when mortal husbandmen were following on
earth their ox-drawn ploughs, Bootes, the ox-driver, though invisible
to the bodily eye, appeared to the mental vision of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page225">[225]</span>
astronomer, following unweariedly the ox-drawn plough in the
sky.</p>

<p>The various suppositions here put forward will lead those who
accept them as probably correct, to picture to themselves the
existence, at the early date of 6000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>, in latitude 45° N., of a
race of men—not savages, and not merely pastoral nomads—but
a race of agriculturists who tilled the ground and reaped its fruits—a
race possessed of high intellectual power—who respected law
and justice, and whose religion taught them to offer to their god
“sacrifices of righteousness.”</p>

<p>In <a href="#PlateXIX_1">Plate XIX., fig. 1</a>, it is the constellation known in the Grecian
sphere as Hercules that claims our attention. At the date and
latitude above named, this constellation, if then it had already
been imagined, culminated gloriously on the northern meridian at
midnight of the spring equinox. The head of the hero, or demi-god,
touched the very zenith, and with his club brandished aloft
he must have seemed well fitted to triumph over, not only the
dragon coiled beneath his feet, but over every opposing power.</p>

<p>As was said at p. 223 about Bootes, 6000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>, so it may here
be repeated of Hercules, 4667 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>, “never since that date has he
held so commanding a position in the sky.”</p>

<p>At the present date of writing, and in our English latitudes,
Hercules “will ever rise reversed,”<a id="FNanchor114" href="#Footnote114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> and through the summer
and autumn months his kneeling figure is always to be seen
hanging head downwards in the southern quarter of the sky.</p>

<p>4600 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span> no such difficult speculations could have presented
themselves to the minds of those who, in the joyous springtime
of the year, beheld in imagination, night after night, the grand
and conquering figure of this god or hero, typifying for them, as
we may easily suppose, the ever-increasing triumph at that season
of the power of light over darkness.</p>

<p><a href="#PlateXIX_2">Plate XIX., fig. 2</a>. It was perhaps at this same date that the
cluster of stars “led round in circle”<a id="FNanchor116" href="#Footnote116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>
close to the bow of Sagittarius,
and exactly marking the equinoctial colure, was figured as a
<i>crown</i>, and that so depicted, as I have contended at page 76, this
constellation suggested the symbolic circle, crown, or wreath
which sometimes takes the place of the bow in Assur’s hand, and
which almost always is present in the hand of Ahura Mazda in
Median representations of that figure.</p>

<p>At <a href="#PlateXX_1">Plate XX., fig. 1</a>, I have drawn the constellation Hydra
as it would have appeared at the date 4667 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>
At <a href="#Page117">pages 117</a>, <a href="#Page118">118</a>,
the reasons which led me to suppose that this constellation was
then first imagined have been given.</p>

<p>At <a href="#PlateXX_2">Plate XX., fig. 2</a>, it may be seen how 4667 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span> the figure
of Orion very accurately marked the equinoctial colure, and this
fact may incline us to suppose that the giant hunter—so often,
according to Grecian legend, in conflict with the powers of high
Heaven—was depicted about this date by ancient astronomers
to represent the strength of the adverse powers which, at the
<i>autumnal</i> season in the mythologies of northern nations, appear in
combat with, and temporarily triumphant over, the powers of light.</p>

<p>In favour of the high date here claimed for the imagining of
Orion’s figure under very much the same form as that still
depicted on our globes, there are some indications to be observed
in the Sanscrit names of the Nakshatra, which contains the stars,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page228">[228]</span>λ φ<sub>1</sub>
φ<sub>2</sub> Orionis—<i>i.e.</i>, the stars marking the head of Orion.</p>

<p>This Nakshatra is known in Hindu astronomy under two quite
different names—viz., Mṛigashirsha and Agrahayani. The Sanscrit
word, Mṛigashirsha, means literally “Wild beast’s head,” and
B. G. Tilak, in his work, <i>The Orion; or, Researches into the
Antiquity of the Vedas</i>, basing his opinion upon many ingenious
and recondite arguments, supposes that ancient Indian astronomers
gave the name of Mṛigashiras to the stars of Orion, which
they imagined portrayed in the sky an “Antelope’s head” transfixed
by an arrow—the arrow being marked by the three bright
stars so well known to us as Orion’s Belt.</p>

<p>Mṛiga, there can be no doubt, carries often with it in Sanscrit
literature the meaning of “antelope”: but Tilak expressly says
at p. 97, “Though I have translated the word <i>Mṛigashiras</i> by
‘Antelope’s head,’ I do not mean to imply that <i>Mṛiga</i> necessarily
meant ‘an antelope’ in the Vedic literature.” Again, at p. 151,
he says: “The word <i>Mṛiga</i> in the Rigveda, means according to
Sâyaṇa both a lion and a deer.”</p>

<p>Again, as to the other name of the Nakshatra—Agrahayani—it
has the meaning of “first-going” (of the sun) understood. In a
long dissertation on this name, Tilak contends that it marked an
important point in the annual course of the sun, and then further
seeks to derive the Greek name Orion from the Sanscrit word,
Agrahayani. Of the value of the etymological arguments advanced,
I am quite unable to judge, but on astronomic grounds it would
not seem an improbable derivation.</p>

<p>But the acceptance of Tilak’s contention as to the derivation
of the name Orion would make it reasonable to suppose that not
only the name but also the configuration of the constellation
might, in the astronomy of the Greek and Indian nations,
resemble each other; and thus we should be more ready to
believe that Mṛigashirsha referred to the lion’s head on Orion’s
arm, and not to an “antelope’s head”—a head which, as depicted
by Tilak at p. 100, would alone have filled nearly all the space in<span class="pagenum" id="Page229">[229]</span>
the heavens occupied in the Grecian sphere by the huge figure of
the giant hunter known to us as Orion.</p>

<p>The indications furnished by these two Sanscrit Nakshatra
names, if they are followed, must lead us to attribute the imagining
and naming of the constellation Orion to a time before that
when the ancestors of the Greeks and Indians went their separate
ways to the west and to the east, and so will strengthen the claim
here made for the depicting of the constellation on the sky as
early as 4600 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span></p>

<p>It will be noted that in the suggestions here offered concerning
Hercules, Corona Australis, Hydra, and Orion, a change in
the symbolic methods followed by earlier astronomers, 6000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>,
must be supposed.</p>

<p>It was to the constellations invisibly <i>accompanying</i> the sun
that the originators of the Zodiac appear to have directed their
attention. But the symbolic figures we have now been studying—there
can, it seems to me, be little doubt—were designed to
mark <i>visibly</i>, and, therefore, in <i>opposition</i> to the sun, the various
seasons of the year.</p>

<p>A great astronomic activity, a sort of astronomic renaissance,
in fact, seems to manifest itself as we study the celestial globe at
4600 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>, and to this date I would attribute the origin of the
astronomic myths of many nations.</p>

<p>In <i>The Median Calendar and the Constellation Taurus</i> I have
put forward considerations drawn from Median and Assyrian
sources, which seemed to me to lead to the conclusion that at
about the date 4000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span> very close attention was given to the
position of the colures amongst the fixed stars, and that at that
date very special honour was given by the ancestors of the Medes
to the constellation Sagittarius—the constellation which at the
spring equinox was in opposition to the sun, and therefore visible
all through the night. I need not here reiterate what was there
advanced on this point concerning Median and Assyrian symbolism,
but rather I now desire to draw attention to the existence
in <i>Egyptian</i> art and mythologic teaching of what I cannot but
think is very constant reference to the position of the colures, as
they might have been observed—speaking in round numbers—from
4000 down to 2000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span></p>

<p>It will be seen at <a href="#PlateXXI_4">Fig. 4</a> that the equinoctial colure, at the
earlier of these dates, touched the confines of the constellation
Sagittarius, and might even then, with almost equal right, have
been claimed as adjoining those of Scorpio. We can well imagine
that the astronomic school which carried out the reformation in
method discussed above (<a href="#Page222">pp. 222</a>, <a href="#Page227">227</a>), which resulted in the imagining
of the constellations Hercules and Corona Australis, and in
the extension, as I suggested, of the boundaries of Sagittarius—we
can well imagine that this school would with reluctance
admit the baleful image of Scorpio to take the post of leader
of the year, so long held by Sagittarius. But from 4000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>
onwards to 2000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span> the constellations
that did actually mark<span class="pagenum" id="Page231">[231]</span>
the equinoctial and solstitial colures, were Taurus, Scorpio, Leo,
and Aquarius.</p>

<p>Volumes of controversy have been written concerning the
astronomic teachings of the ceilings of the temples of Denderah
and Edfu, as to the position of the colures amongst the fixed
stars, suggested by the arrangement of the figures of the Zodiac
in both these temples. The date astronomically referred to in
these designs was claimed by some to be about 4000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>, but
when it was proved that these temples had been restored in
Ptolemaic times, and the ceilings probably redecorated then, the
high claims put forward for the first imagining of these astronomic
designs could no longer with certainty be upheld. A strong
reaction in opinion then took place, and it was again and again
asserted that the Egyptians were probably not even acquainted
with the so-called Grecian twelve-fold division of the ecliptic
till after the introduction of European culture into Egypt. To
seek for allusions in ancient Egyptian mythology or art to any of
the twelve Zodiacal constellations was, therefore, a much discouraged
attempt.</p>

<p>But if the testimony of the ceilings of the Denderah and Edfu
temples is rendered suspect by their Ptolemaic restoration, the
same objection cannot be raised against the evidence borne by
the ceiling of an ancient Egyptian building, which has certainly
not been restored in Ptolemaic times. In the <i>Description de
l’Égypte</i>,<a id="FNanchor118" href="#Footnote118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>
we find a careful drawing of a “Tableau astronomique
au Plafond de l’un des tombeaux des rois.” In the central portion
on either side of this ceiling a monstrous hippopotamus and crocodile
are represented, together with various beings depicted on a
much smaller scale. In the drawing here given, of one of these
central groups, we find, as it seems to me, very clear reference
to the four figures—Taurus, Scorpio, Leo, and Aquarius
(= Amphora).</p>

<p>The monstrous hippopotamus and crocodile here depicted
are, I am strongly inclined
to believe, representations,
not of any particular constellation,
but rather of
the solstitial and equinoctial
colures; and the four not at
all, except astronomically, related
figures of the Bull,
Scorpion, Lion, and Water-jar,
are here very clearly in
evidence.</p>

<div class="figleft w20emmax">

<img src="images/illo275.jpg" alt="">

<p class="caption">BULL APIS</p>

</div><!--figleft-->

<p>In Egyptian mythology the
Apis Bull held a very important place. “It was regarded as a
symbol and incarnation of Osiris, the husband of Isis, and next to
Râ, the great divinity of Egypt.” Grecian authorities tell us that
the Apis Bull was black, with some distinctive white markings;
and on its back (or tongue, according to variant accounts) the
figure of a scarabæus was to be observed. From a drawing in
Ebers’ <i>Egypt</i>, Vol. I., p. 121, we may, however, gather, as I think
I have seen it elsewhere stated, that the Apis Bull was marked by
<i>equal</i> areas of black and white. Such equal areas would fitly
symbolize the equal day and night of the equinoctial season, and
the presence of the scarabæus on the back or tongue of the Bull—if
the suggestion made at <a href="#Page218">p. 218</a> should prove to be correct—would
point to the traditional connexion of that creature with the
same equinoctial season.</p>

<p>It has often been assumed that the golden calf set up and
worshipped in the wilderness by the Israelites was a representation
of the Apis god of Egypt; and that so also were the calves
set up by Jeroboam in Bethel and in Dan on his return from<span class="pagenum" id="Page234">[234]</span>
Egypt. We read in 1 Kings xii. 32, “And Jeroboam ordained a
feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month.”
... Ver. 33, “So he offered upon the altar which he had made
in Bethel the fifteenth day of the eighth month, even in the
month which he had devised of his own heart; and ordained a
feast unto the children of Israel: and he offered upon the altar,
and burnt incense.”</p>

<p>Now, from our knowledge of the Babylonian calendar, and
its correspondence with that in use in Palestine, we may conclude
that the “eighth month” (Marchesvan), devised by Jeroboam,
was that during which the sun traversed the constellation Scorpio,
and during which Taurus was dominantly visible all night;
and when in this constellation the full moon of the fifteenth or
festival day was to be observed. This mention of the <i>eighth</i>
month in connexion with the worship of the golden calves—a
worship, as has been supposed, copied from Egyptian practice—greatly
strengthens the opinion that the Apis Bull was in Egypt
looked upon as a living representative of the Zodiacal Bull—the
constellation which in the time of the early dynasties marked, in
opposition to the sun, the autumnal equinox.</p>

<p>In Median mythology and art we have seen the great importance
of Tauric symbolism: but there is a wide difference between
the Tauric symbolism of the Medes and the Egyptians. Mithras,
the Median sun-god, again and again triumphs over and slays the
Bull. In Egypt, on the contrary, the Sacred Bull is honoured
and worshipped during its lifetime, and reverently embalmed,
and with all pomp and glory buried after its death.</p>

<p>This difference in the mythologic conceptions of Media and
Egypt may be attributed, I think, to the difference of climatic
conditions in the two countries.</p>

<p>In Media, spring—in Egypt, autumn—is the joyous and
fruitful season of the year. In the early ages, when Median and
Egyptian mythologies took their rise, Taurus was at the spring<span class="pagenum" id="Page235">[235]</span>
equinox in conjunction with the sun, and was, therefore, slain by
its overwhelming brightness; but at the autumn equinox that
same constellation, <i>in opposition</i>, rose when the sun set, and all
night long was visible. In Median art, it is the Bull immolated
by the sun in springtime that is represented. In Egyptian symbolism,
it is to the Bull triumphantly traversing the sky by night,
in the autumn season, that attention is directed.</p>

<p>In the light of these astronomic considerations, it is interesting
to think of the fanatical act of Cambyses in slaying the Apis Bull,
as one prompted not only by fury at seeing the high honour paid
to the Egyptian god, but also by an insane pride, which made
him desire to imitate the triumph of Mithras—the Persian sun-god—over
the Bull in the heavens, by killing its earthly representative,
the Apis Bull.</p>

<p>In the days of Cambyses, when Apis worship prevailed in
Egypt, and even still earlier when the children of Israel, in
imitation of this worship, set up the golden calf in the wilderness,
the <i>raison d’être</i> for the honour paid to Taurus as a star mark of
the autumnal season no longer existed; for we know that about
1800 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>, the equinoctial colure had left that constellation, and
had entered the eastern degrees of the constellation Aries.
Egyptian history assures us, however, that the institution of the
Apis worship was effected by some king of the first dynasty
in the far back ages when Taurus, Scorpio, Leo, and Aquarius
did actually preside over the four seasons of the year. Moreover,
the recent discoveries of the tombs of kings and other
personages, in the first Egyptian dynasty, lead us back to the
remote date of 4000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>, when the very earliest observations
of the colures in the four above-named constellations could
have been made.</p>

<p>In these ancient tombs, amongst other objects, have been
found slate slabs of various shapes—some of them, in their
general outline, as it appears to me, representing in the flat the<span class="pagenum" id="Page236">[236]</span>
form of a jar or vase. In the accompanying cuts, a proposed
restoration of the broken-off top of one of the slates is given, and is
distinguished from the existing portion of the slate by being drawn
in dotted lines. Both sides of these slabs are covered by finely
executed carvings, not incised but in relief. The subjects of the
reliefs are very varied, but prominent amongst them, and exactly
repeated more than once, is the figure of a bull trampling under
his feet, and preparing to gore with his horns, a fallen human foe.
Lions are also portrayed in many attitudes, and on one slate,
where in the upper register this triumphing bull is represented,
below it in a crenellated cartouche a lion and an urn or jar are to
be seen in close proximity to each other. On another slate, a
scorpion is delineated above a crenellated cartouche; and representations
of scorpions carved in relief on mace-heads and on
jars, and scorpions carved in the round, have been met with in
great numbers in the excavations at Hierakonpolis—the site also
of the discovery of one of the most important of the carved slates
here described.</p>

<p>It is difficult, I think, to resist the conclusion that we have in
the carvings on these ancient slate objects references not to merely
terrestrial bulls, lions, scorpions, and water jars, but rather to the
constellations, already imagined under those forms, whose stars, at
the date when these carvings were made, marked in conjunction
with, and in opposition to, the sun, the four seasons of the
year.<a id="FNanchor119" href="#Footnote119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote119" href="#FNanchor119" class="label">[119]</a>
In the centre of many, if not of all, of the slates under our notice, there is
carved on the obverse a ring surrounding a depression. “Mr Quibell’s
theory, which is still adhered to by Professor Petrie, is that this ring was
intended to receive the green paint with which it is supposed the earliest
Egyptians painted their faces,” but Mr Legge in his Paper, from which I have
here quoted (contributed to the <i>Proceedings of the Society of Biblical Archæology</i>,
May 1900, pp. 137, 138), puts forward a different view, which, if it is
correct, would lend support to the astronomic interpretation above proposed
for some of the carved representations. Mr Legge considers that the rings
represented the sun, and that “it is quite possible that this significance was
heightened by the introduction of some bright substance, such as gold foil.”
He points out that the composite monsters of the slates, all of which are represented
on certain ivories, which he names, are always associated with the sun-disk.
He believes these figures to have a symbolic meaning, though he does
not in his Paper claim the especial astronomic interpretations I have above
advocated.</p>

<p>In Grecian legend Cepheus, Cassiopeia, Andromeda, the sea-monster
(Cetus), and Perseus are associated together, and on the
Grecian sphere five neighbouring constellations represent the
actors of the legend.</p>

<p>Studying these constellations as they must have appeared to
observers of the heavens at different dates, we shall, I think, see
some reason to attribute the imagining of the figure of the hero
Perseus to a later age than that of the other members of the
group, and, on the other hand, there are considerations which may
make us hesitate whether we should not place the origin of the
constellation Andromeda at an even earlier date than those of
Cepheus, Cassiopeia, and the sea-monster.<a id="FNanchor121" href="#Footnote121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> One point in the
legend, however, finds strong astronomic support from a study of
the precessional globe—namely, the fact that Cepheus and Cassiopeia
were personages of Ethiopian—<i>i.e.</i>, of tropical provenance.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote121" href="#FNanchor121" class="label">[121]</a> See below at <a href="#Page246">p. 246</a>,

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>It will be seen in <a href="#PlateXXII_1">Plate XXII., fig. 1</a>, that only in a latitude
as far South as 18° N. could the figure of Cassiopeia—even at the
early date of 6000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>—have been imagined as that of a queen
seated in royal dignity, and visible in the northern quarter of the
heavens.</p>

<p>By referring to <a href="#PlateXV">Plate XV.</a>, we may learn that in Lat. 45° N. at
that date, Cassiopeia would have appeared in the southern quarter
of the sphere, head downwards, while the figure of Cepheus could
only have been observed by turning first to one and then to the
other quarter of the sky. As, however, the <i>head of Cepheus</i> would
have marked so exactly the solstitial colure 6000
<span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>, it seemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page240">[240]</span>
to me only right to seek for a latitude in which his figure and that
of his queen should appear upright and in the same quarter of the
heavens—a latitude, therefore, in which it might be possible to
suppose these constellations had been originated as star-marks of
the solstitial season. To attain this object it was necessary to
set the globe to the very low latitude of 18° N.</p>

<p>To suppose at 6000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span> so wide a diffusion, not only of the
human race, but also of astronomical science and authority,
seemed to involve an historical unlikelihood. Moreover, even
if for the sake of suitably establishing the dignity of this regal pair
one were tempted to suppose the great improbability of schools of
astronomy existing, and with equal authority instituting constellations
as star-marks for the year, in regions as far north as Lat.
45° N. and as far south as 18° N.—even so, I do not think the
position of the constellations themselves in relation to the solstitial
colure as shown in the diagram is by any means so convincingly
symmetrical as to force us to accept the date 6000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span> for their
origin. The head only of Cepheus appears on the meridian, his
figure and the whole constellation of Cassiopeia lie considerably
to the east of that line.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances it is satisfactory to find at a later,
and therefore at a more historically probable date, and still in an
Ethiopian (tropical) latitude, a meridian line on and about which
the constellations Cepheus, Cassiopeia, Andromeda, and Cetus
form a well-balanced group.</p>

<p>This meridian, it is true, is not that of a solstice or an equinox;
but it is one which marked a very important astronomical moment—namely,
the commencement of the calendrical year—the year
counted from the entry of the sun into the constellation Aries.
(See <a href="#PlateXXII_2">Plate XXII., fig. 2</a>.)</p>

<p>Of the high calendrical importance attached through thousands
of years to this point in the sun’s annual course by the Accadian
and Babylonian nations and by the Hindus down to the present<span class="pagenum" id="Page241">[241]</span>
day, astronomic records testify. Egyptian mythology and Chinese
traditions also, as I have claimed, refer to it: it need not, therefore,
surprise us to find constellations imagined to mark the
beginning of a year counted from that point, even at a date when
this beginning did not coincide either with solstice or equinox.</p>

<p>3500 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span> is the approximate date I would suggest in a latitude
not far from 23° N. for the origin of the constellations Cepheus,
Cassiopeia, and probably also for that of Cetus.</p>

<p>The legend tells us that Cassiopeia by boasting of her own or
of her daughter’s surpassing beauty incurred the enmity of the
nereids. She is</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent00">“... that starr’d Ethiop queen that strove</div>
<div class="verse indent0">To set her beauty’s praise above</div>

<p>It seems to me that for this legend, as for many others, an
astronomic basis may be assigned. 3500 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span> the solstitial colure
passed through the constellation Aquarius. The stars of that
constellation might then not unfitly have been likened to sea
divinities, and rival schools of astronomers and calendar keepers
may have exalted the praise, on the one hand, of the stars that
marked a calendrical, and, on the other hand, of those that
marked a solstitial year.</p>

<p>A curious fact as to the lines in which Aratos refers to the
constellation Cassiopeia must here be noted.</p>

<p>Aratos versified “the <i>Phainomena</i> of the astronomer Eudoxos,
who lived cir. <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span> 403-350.” It has often been pointed out that
the facts concerning the constellations which Aratos and Eudoxos
record “are to a great extent traditional and archaic, and belong
to another and far earlier epoch.” What is said of Cassiopeia is a
case in point; for thus the poet deplores her pride and its punishment
at line 654 <i>et seq.</i>—</p>

<i>The Phainomena or “Heavenly Display” of Aratos</i>, <i>ub. supr.</i></p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>Now in Eudoxos’ time and in his latitude, though Cassiopeia’s
head did by a few degrees extend into the southern heavens, yet
her position was not so deplorably ignominious as the poem would
suggest. Three thousand years earlier the pity for her expressed
by Aratos would have been more appropriate, for then her whole
figure for observers in lat. 35° N. would have been visible in the
southern quarter of the sky, and her feet, not her head (as at
Lat. 23° N.), would have been on the zenith.</p>

<p>These considerations may lead us to suppose that the idea of
Cassiopeia’s pride, and the fit punishment of it—<i>i.e.</i>, her reversed
position in the heavens, must have assumed form in <i>northern</i>
latitudes almost at as early a date as the constellation figures were
first imagined in <i>tropical</i> latitudes.</p>

<p>If this be so, it is indeed curious to find a legend which embodied
the <i>animus</i> of astronomic rivalry 3500 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span> handed down for
thousands of years, and repeated in what professed to be a somewhat
scientific treatise at a date between 400 and 300 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>, when the
astronomic facts no longer tallied with those narrated in the legend.</p>

<p>As to Andromeda, the classic story describes her as the
daughter of Cepheus and Cassiopeia; but the constellation itself—except
on legendary grounds—might equally well have marked
the beginning of a solstitial year 6000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>, or of a non-solstitial
and calendrical year 3500 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span></p>

<p>The terrible prevalence of human sacrifices in ancient times,
and at the solstices especially, may make us almost fear that the
representation of a chained human victim had its place in the
sphere at the earlier (solstitial) date.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page243">[243]</span></p>

<p>The chains which bind Andromeda’s arms are fastened by
staples to the sky. They appear (at <a href="#PlateXXII_1">fig. 1</a>) at 6000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span> as though
driven into two important astronomic lines—<i>i.e.</i>, one of them into
the line of the equator, the other into that of the solstitial colure.
This may, of course, be a mere coincidence, and should not be
allowed to weigh at all heavily in the almost evenly adjusted
balance of probabilities regarding the date of the origin of the
constellation Andromeda. Her story is so interwoven, not only
with that of Cepheus and Cassiopeia, but also with that of the sea-monster
Cetus, that we should not hastily attempt to dissociate
the members of this group.</p>

<p>The very interesting question as to what southern people first
depicted the Ethiopic king and queen on the sphere cannot be
answered on astronomic grounds. We know that the latitude in
which these figures were imagined must have been tropical, if the
date of their imagining was as early as 3500 <i>B.C.</i> But we cannot
learn from the celestial globe what was the longitude of the land
in which they were so imagined. Ethiopia proper, and parts of
Arabia and India, lie within the tropics, and the term Ethiopia,
in classic writings, embraces all these countries.</p>

<p>Etymologists are, I believe, divided in opinion as to what
language the rather un-Grecian names, Cepheus and Cassiopeia,
were derived from. Some writers have suggested for their origin
the Sanscrit names Capuja and Cassyape: and if, as I have
already urged, the Aries-year was followed in ancient Vedic times
in India, the Sanscrit derivation suggested will seem not an unlikely
one. Nor under these suppositions would it be difficult to
propose a possible Sanscrit origin for the name Andromeda,
though for this purpose we should have to deprive the legend of
all its classic and romantic charm. Cassyape, in Sanscrit story, is
not the name of a gloriously beautiful queen, but of a “sage,” and
it might be that the constellation Andromeda also, for ancient
Indian astronomers, represented merely a <i>human</i> sacrifice, not that<span class="pagenum" id="Page244">[244]</span>
of the beautiful daughter of a beautiful mother. Though in the
Rig Veda there is no legend of the sacrifice of a woman, yet in it
we meet with seven consecutive hymns referring to the sacrifice,
real or symbolical, of Sunahśepas, the son of a rishi or sage, who,
according to the commentators, had consented to yield his son up
to this cruel fate. The prayers of the victim, addressed to many
gods, at last result in his deliverance.</p>

<p>Two other hymns in the Rig Veda relate to the great ceremony
of the sacrifice, real or symbolical, of a horse. I give at <a href="#Page252">p. 252</a>
some of the considerations which have convinced me that the
praises of the winged steed—<i>i.e.</i>, of the constellation Pegasus,
and not merely the praises of an earthly horse, are the subject of
these two hymns. The ceremony in question bore the name of
Aswamedha, literally Horse-Sacrifice.</p>

<p>In reading and comparing these two series of sacrificial
hymns, some points of contact present themselves, and, observing
this, it occurred to me that some Sanscrit word ending in <i>Medha</i>—<i>i.e.</i>,
sacrifice, and conveying the meaning of <i>human sacrifice</i>,
might by ancient Indian astronomers have been attached to the
constellation, which for us represents the hapless Andromeda:
for if we suppose that the constellations Cassiopeia and Cepheus
were imagined in India, but adopted with an appropriate legend
into the Grecian sphere—the names of the personages in the
legend at the same time suffering a Grecian change—it would be
easy further to suppose that the Indian name of the constellation
near to them, transformed and misunderstood, came to represent
in Grecian story not merely a <i>human</i> sacrifice, but that of the
much-to-be-pitied daughter of the proud Cassiopeia.</p>

<p>Whether these fanciful speculations concerning the names of
the actors in the ancient legend be adopted or not need not affect
our judgment as to the reasonableness, or otherwise, of the date,
3500 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>, and of Lat. 23° N. for the origin of the constellational
group here discussed.</p>

<p>The probable dates for the first imagining of four constellations
are here given—namely, for the Centaur, Ophiuchus, Auriga,
and Perseus.</p>

<p>For the Centaur the date in round numbers of 3500 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span> (<a href="#PlateXXIII_1">fig.
1</a>) is suggested: at that date his huge figure would have well
marked, in opposition, the beginning of the calendrical Aries-year;
or, in conjunction with the sun, the beginning of the seventh
month of the same year. It is not necessary, at that date, to
attribute a low latitude to the astronomers who designed this
figure: in that of 35° N., as shown in the diagram, the whole
constellation would then have been well above the horizon. The
much earlier epoch of 6000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span> might perhaps be claimed for the
Centaur. At that date, as I have assumed, the calendrical and
the solstitial year coincided. (Compare <a href="#PlateXVII">Plate XVII.</a> and <a href="#PlateIX">Plate
IX.</a>) As between 6000 and 3500 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span> I have often hesitated, but
on the whole I have come to think the later date, as here given,
the more probable.</p>

<p><a href="#PlateXXIII_2">Fig. 2</a>.—Again at the date 3500 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span> and in the latitude
35° N. I have drawn the constellation Ophiuchus as it would have
appeared in opposition to the sun at the season of the spring
equinox; triumphing over the powers of darkness—namely, the
scorpion on which he treads and the serpent which he crushes
with his hands. Although at the date in question Hercules’ position
in the northern heavens was not quite so commanding and
symmetrical as it was a thousand years earlier (see <a href="#PlateXIX">Plate XIX.</a>), yet
in the lower latitude given here (<a href="#PlateXXIII_2">Plate XXIII., fig. 2</a>)
the heads of<span class="pagenum" id="Page246">[246]</span>
Hercules and of Ophiuchus would have been on the zenith, and
these brothers might have been seen, one of them in the northern
and the other in the southern quarter of the sky, strongly combating
and conquering the forces of winter and darkness at the
season of the spring equinox.</p>

<p><a href="#PlateXXIII_3">Fig. 3</a>.—For Auriga, I have suggested the later date of 3000
<span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>, for then the bright star Capella, the most important star in
the constellation and one of the brightest in that part of the sky,
was on the meridian in conjunction with the sun at noon of the
spring equinox—and in opposition at mid-night of the autumn
equinox.</p>

<p>The star Capella has, by several writers, been identified with
the star “Icu of Babylon” mentioned in many of the Babylonian
astrological texts. If this identification of Capella and “Icu
of Babylon” should be established as correct, we ought, I suppose,
to credit <i>Babylonian</i> astronomers with the delineation of the figure
Auriga.</p>

<p><a href="#PlateXXIII_4">Fig. 4</a>.—Unless we adopt on the authority of the Cepheus,
Cassiopeia, and Andromeda legend the date 3500 for Perseus, it
will seem, I think, almost necessary to attribute the much later
one of 1433 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span> for the designing of this constellation. At the
earlier date the position of Perseus—see <a href="#PlateXXII_2">Plate XXII., fig. 2</a>—militates
against the likelihood of its having then been imagined;
as part of the figure of Perseus would have been visible in the
northern and part in the southern hemisphere.</p>

<p>In favour of the later date we may note the way in which the
figure of Perseus has been fitted in, as it were, between already-named
constellations, so that though restricted to a small space it
still retains heroic proportions.</p>

<p>The star Algol, whose strange alternations of magnitude may
well have suggested to the ancients the <i>winking</i> of the eye of some
malignant monster, was imagined by the astronomers who drew
the figure of Perseus, as on the brow of the Gorgon Medusa. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page247">[247]</span>
will be seen in the <a href="#PlateXXIII">Plate</a> how, at the date there given, this mysterious
star exactly marked the equinoctial meridian.</p>

<p>The northern latitude 40° N., suitable for the imagining of this
constellation, and its name Perseus, seem to point to an Iranian
school of astronomers as the probable originators of this figure.</p>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>It will be seen that by consulting the precessional globe it has
been possible to suggest dates at which the various simple and
composite human figures, represented on the (Grecian) sphere
could have been originally imagined in an upright position, either
on the northern or southern meridian at some well-marked time
of the year—that is of either a cosmical or a calendrical year.</p>

<p>That many other of the remaining ancient constellations—Canis
Major and Canis Minor, Aquila, Cygnus, &amp;c., were depicted
and named at very remote dates, there can, I think, be little doubt.
The wide-spread traditions connected with these figures demand
an early origin for them. It is probable that the <i>heliacal rising</i> of
certain bright stars in these constellations at some special season
of the year, rather than their <i>culmination at noon or at midnight</i>,
may have been the occasion for the interest taken in
them.</p>

<p>A further study of the precessional globe with this thought
present would probably suggest approximate dates for the imagining
of some of these constellations, small in extent but marked by
bright stars.</p>

<p>I will now only allude to the two remaining ancient constellations
of <i>wide extent</i>—namely, to Argo and Pegasus.</p>

<p>Glancing at <a href="#PlateX">Plate X.</a> (Astronomy in the Rig Veda) the
almost upright and symmetrical position of Argo 3000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span> may
suggest the likelihood that at that date or perhaps a few hundred
years later, and in a latitude about 12° higher than that given in
the diagram, this constellation was imagined. It will be observed
that all the stars of Argo, even the bright and southern Canopus
at 35° N. would have been above the horizon and visible at midnight
of the winter solstice. At noon of the summer solstice<span class="pagenum" id="Page249">[249]</span>
they would have been above the horizon, but invisible in conjunction
with the sun.</p>

<p>But now turning our thoughts to the constellation Pegasus, a
difficulty confronts us at every date from 6000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span> downwards
even to this present <span class="smcapall">A.D.</span> 1903: Pegasus as depicted on the globe
has held and still holds a reversed position in the heavens. The
very fact that for all the other ancient constellations which represent
living beings, it has been possible to find some season and
some date at which they could have been observed upright in the
sky, makes it a more imperative need to seek for some explanation
of the anomalous treatment meted out by astronomers of old to
the winged steed.</p>

<p>In this stress of difficulty, I venture to make a suggestion
which will, I fear, at first sight, appear far-fetched and fanciful,
and quite out of line with other suppositions put forward in this
book.</p>

<p>My suggestion is that an error concerning the right depicting
of this constellation was fallen into by some astronomers of old,
and that this error was handed down to us through the Grecian
school.</p>

<p>If on some clear autumnal or winter night we search for the
constellation Pegasus, not on a globe or map but in the southern
quarter of the actual sky, we may quickly recognise it by four
very bright stars which mark the corners of an almost exact and
very extensive <i>square</i> on the vault of heaven. Then stretching
away from the lower and western corner of this square still farther
towards the horizon and to the west, we may trace the faint stars
which mark the neck, and the somewhat brighter star which marks
the head of the Demi-Horse: while starting from the upper western
corner of the square and stretching still higher towards the zenith,
and to the west we detect the lines of fainter stars which mark the
fore legs and the hoofs of Pegasus. If we allow the four stars of
the “square of Pegasus” still to mark the body of the horse, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page250">[250]</span>
think of the upper lines of faint stars as marking its neck and head
and of the lower ones as marking its fore legs and hoofs, the
figure exactly reversed will still fit within the limiting lines of the
constellation, with the satisfactory result that the winged steed,
not miserably floundering on its back but upright and alert, will
be seen in our mental vision night after night pursuing its course
from east to west across the heavens.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>But even to arrive at so satisfactory a result, we might scarcely
dare to propose without some other plea than its mere desirability,
so arbitrary a method of dealing with the reversed position of
Pegasus, as that of thus correcting a supposed error on the part of
early astronomers.</p>

<p>There is, however, I think, in Grecian and in Vedic legend
some support to be found for the opinion that the original position
of Pegasus was upright and not reversed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page251">[251]</span></p>

<p>Though on the Grecian astronomic sphere Pegasus appears
reversed, on no artistic monument, vase, or coin is he thus represented,
and in Grecian legend he is ever a glorious and highly-prized
friend and helper of gods and heroes. Amongst other achievements,
we read of him that he produced with a blow of his hoof
the inspiring fountain Hippocrene.</p>

<p>In the Rig Veda we read of a swift horse, belonging to the
Aswins, who from his hoof filled a hundred vases of sweet liquor.</p>

<p>Max Müller has pointed out that the Aswins possessed a horse
called Pagas. The stars α and β Arietis are in Hindu astronomy
called the “Aswins,” and at <a href="#Page137">p. 137</a> I have contended that
these stars in Vedic times symbolised the twin heroes, the Aswins,
the possessors, according to Max Müller, of the horse Pagas. If
we look at Pegasus in the sky, and observe how closely following
that constellation the bright stars that mark the head of Aries
appear, we shall easily understand how these Aswins might have
by Vedic bards been imagined as possessing and driving in front
of them the swift steed Pegasus.</p>

<p>In two hymns addressed to the Aswins we read as
follows:<a id="FNanchor125" href="#Footnote125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>—</p>

<p class="center blankbefore75"><span class="smcap">Maṇḍala I.</span>—Súkta cxvi. and verse 7.</p>

<p class="blankbefore75">“You filled from the hoof of your vigorous steed, as if from a
cask, a hundred jars of wine.”</p>

<p>And again in the next hymn, cxvii. verse 6—</p>

<p>“You filled for the (expectant) man a hundred vases of sweet
(liquors) from the hoof of your fleet horse.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote125" href="#FNanchor125" class="label">[125]</a> Wilson’s translation of the Rig Veda.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>As Pegasus is now represented his hoofs touch no well or
fountain, cask or vase. But if we depict him as suggested above
(see <a href="#PlateXXIV">Plate XXIV.</a>), his hoof would indeed appear as almost in the
act of striking the vase in the constellation Aquarius, from which
the abundant waters gush forth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page252">[252]</span></p>

<p>I have already alluded to the Aswamedha hymns in the Rig
Veda as probably referring not merely to the sacrifice of an actual
horse, but rather to a symbolic sacrifice of the winged horse of
the constellation Pegasus. In support of this opinion I will quote
from the hymns in question:—</p>

<p class="center blankbefore75"><span class="smcap">Maṇḍala I.</span>—Súkta clxii.</p>

<p class="blankbefore75">“1. Let neither MITRA nor VARUN̂A, ARYAMAN, ÁYU,
INDRA, RIBHUKSHIN, nor the <i>Maruts</i> censure us: when
we proclaim in the sacrifice the virtues of the swift horse sprung
from the gods.</p>

<p>“2. When they, (the priests), bring the prepared offering to
the presence (of the horse), who has been bathed and decorated
with rich (trappings), the various-coloured goat going before
him, bleating, becomes an acceptable offering to INDRA and
PÚSHAN.</p>

<p>“3. This goat, the portion of PÚSHAN, fit for all the gods, is
brought first with the fleet courser, so that TWASHT́ṚI may
prepare him along with the horse, as an acceptable preliminary
offering for the (sacrificial) food.”</p>

<p class="blankbefore75">Looking at <a href="#PlateXXIV_1">Plate XXIV.,
Figs. 1</a>, <a href="#PlateXXIV_2">2</a>, we may observe how the
constellation Capricornus “goes before” that of Pegasus, and we
may understand the aspiration that Twasht́ṛi may prepare him
along with the horse as an acceptable preliminary offering.</p>

<p>After many verses entering into minute and rather horrible
details of the “immolation” and even of the cooking of the
sacrificial horse the 19th verse adds—</p>

<p>“There is one immolator of the radiant horse, which is
Time”; and these words seem to carry us back from thoughts of
an actual to a, in some way, symbolical sacrifice, especially when
at verse 21 we read:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page253">[253]</span></p>

<p>“Verily at this moment thou dost not die; nor art thou
harmed; for thou goest by auspicious paths to the gods. The
horses of INDRA, the steeds of the <i>Maruts</i> shall be yoked (to
their cars), and a courser shall be placed in the shaft of the ass of
the AŚWINS (to bear thee to heaven).”</p>

<p>The following hymn (lxiii.) I give <i>in extenso</i>:—</p>

<p class="center blankbefore75"><span class="smcap">Maṇḍala I.</span>—Súkta clxiii.</p>

<p class="blankbefore75" id="Verse1">1. Thy great birth, O Horse, is to be glorified; whether
first springing from the firmament or from the water, inasmuch
as thou hast neighed (auspiciously), for thou hast the wings of
the falcon and the limbs of the deer.</p>

<p id="Verse2">2. TRITA harnessed the horse which was given by YAMA:
INDRA first mounted him, and GANDHARBA seized his
reins. <i>Vasus</i>, you fabricated the horse from the sun.</p>

<p id="Verse3">3. Thou, horse, art YAMA: thou art A’DITYA: thou art
TRITA by a mysterious act: thou art associated with SOMA.
The sages have said there are three bindings of thee in heaven.</p>

<p id="Verse4">4. They have said that three are thy bindings in heaven;
three upon earth; and three in the firmament. Thou declarest to
me, Horse, who art (one with) VARUN̂A, that which they have
called thy most excellent birth.</p>

<p id="Verse5">5. I have beheld, Horse, these thy purifying (regions); these
impressions of the feet of thee, who sharest in the sacrifice; and
here thy auspicious reins, which are the protectors of the rite that
preserve it.</p>

<p id="Verse6">6. I recognise in my mind thy form afar off, going from
(the earth) below, by way of heaven, to the sun. I behold thy
head soaring aloft, and mounting quickly by unobstructed paths,
unsullied by dust.</p>

<p id="Verse7">7. I behold thy most excellent form coming eagerly to
(receive) thy food in thy (holy) place of earth; when thy attendant<span class="pagenum" id="Page254">[254]</span>
brings thee nigh to the enjoyment (of the provender), therefore
greedy, thou devourest the fodder.</p>

<p id="Verse8">8. The car follows thee, O Horse: men attend thee; cattle
follow thee; the loveliness of maidens (waits) upon thee; troops
of demi-gods following thee have sought thy friendship; the
gods themselves have been admirers of thy vigour.</p>

<p id="Verse9">9. His mane is of gold; his feet are of iron; and fleet as
thought, INDRA is his inferior (in speed). The gods have come
to partake of his (being offered as) oblation; the first who
mounted the horse was INDRA.</p>

<p id="Verse10">10. The full-haunched, slender-waisted, high-spirited, and
celestial coursers (of the sun), gallop along like swans in rows,
when the horses spread along the heavenly path.</p>

<p id="Verse11">11. Thy body, horse, is made for motion; thy mind is rapid
(in intention) as the wind; the hairs (of thy mane) are tossed in
manifold directions; and spread beautiful in the forests.</p>

<p id="Verse12">12. The swift horse approaches the place of immolation,
meditating with mind intent upon the gods; the goat bound to
him is led before him; after him follow the priests and the
singers.</p>

<p id="Verse13">13. The horse proceeds to that assembly which is most
excellent: to the presence of his father and his mother (heaven
and earth). Go, (Horse), to-day rejoicing to the gods, that (the
sacrifice) may yield blessings to the donor.</p>

<p class="blankbefore75">Many passages in this hymn, such as those in <a href="#Verse3">verse 3</a>
referring to Trita and Soma, may suggest corroborative astronomic
observations,<a id="FNanchor126" href="#Footnote126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>
 but I would here especially refer to the description,
<a href="#Verse1">verse 1</a>, of the horse possessing “the wings of the falcon,” and in
<a href="#Verse6">verse 6</a> to the words, “I behold <i>thy head soaring aloft</i>, and
mounting quickly by unobstructed paths, unsullied by dust.”</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>As I read these hymns I cannot think merely of an actual<span class="pagenum" id="Page255">[255]</span>
horse led to sacrifice, but of the winged celestial Pegasus; nor is
it easy to think of that celestial horse as it is at present depicted,
<i>reversed</i> in the sky.</p>

<p>The Vedic poet beheld his head soaring aloft, but in the
previous verse he has said, “I have beheld Horse, ... those
impressions of the feet of thee”; and if these “impressions”
were the stars which, on the Grecian sphere, marked the horse’s
head, but, as I have contended, originally marked his hoof, then
we shall understand how, associated with Soma, and identical
with Trita by a mysterious act—<i>i.e.</i>, at the season of the summer
solstice, and when the moon was at its full in the constellation
Aquarius, ancient astronomers imagined to themselves the horse
Pegasus producing with his hoof the sweet exhilarating waters of
the fountain Hippocrene.</p>

<p>The date of this particular legend concerning the hoof of
Pegasus I should be inclined to place at about 3000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>, when
the solstitial colure was so closely marked by “those impressions
of the feet” of the “swift horse sprung from the gods.”
For the first imagining of the constellation I think that of 4000
<span class="smcapall">B.C.</span> is more probable (see <a href="#PlateXXIV_1">Plate XXIV., Figs. 1</a>,
<a href="#PlateXXIV_2">2</a>).</p>

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this

</div>

works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
